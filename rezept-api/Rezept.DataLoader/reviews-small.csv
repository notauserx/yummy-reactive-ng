157,316,3627,Erdal Onurhan,"This is in fact not a Greek dish, but Turkish.  ""Dolma"" means ""Stuffing, Stuffed"" in Turkish and the origins of this dish go back to authentic Ottoman Imperial Cuisine. In fact there are very many other stuffed vegetable dishes in the Turkish Cuisine, such as eggplants, arthichokes, marrow(zuccihini) and its blossoms, potatoes etc.  This term, stuffed, is also used for dishes where chicken, turkey and the like are stuffed with various ingredients, mainly rice, before cooking usually in the oven.",11/28/2000 19:20:00,11/28/2000 19:20:00

170,607,3731,Wei-Li Eastlake,"The French Onion soup recipe is one of the most popular dish served at the Famous Barr (also part of the May Dept store group) restaurants found in St.Louis.   Based on my travels to the various countries including Europe, Asia and US, this version of French Onion soup is one of the best I've had. My husband who is from London just loves this recipe.

It is robust and hearty in beef and onion flavour and quite thick so you can enjoy this as a meal in itself (you might say it's great comfort food).  Be sure to use the broiler until the cheese bubbles and turns golden brown over the French bread. Tip: Try to use the fresh French bread which is a bit chewy in texture.    

Bon Appetit.",12/04/2000 17:05:09,12/04/2000 17:05:09

227,809,4177,Fran Kelly,"While on my first visit to Ireland in July 1999, the birthplace of parents, my cousin and I stopped in Doolen near the Cliffs of Mohr and had this marvelous dark Irish Beef Stew cooked in Guinness Stout""  at O'Connors Pub.  It was absolutely delicous and the first authentic Irish meal we had and while all the food was great there was nothing that could beat the Irish Stew.  When I found the recipe on this site, I immediately tried it and it is exactly like what we had in Ireland.  When my cousin came to dinner and I served it, he was sure I had gotten the recipe from O'Connors Pub while we were in Ireland.  It was a cinch to make, directions were very easy to follow and it practically cooks itself.  It is equally as good over mashed potatoes or rice.  Try it, you'll like it. The one ingredient I added was a ""wee bit of blarney""",12/27/2000 19:38:08,12/27/2000 19:38:08

I utilized fresh cranberries, red seedless grapes, and braeburn apples with fresh made whipped cream (i chopped fresh pecans on the side for those who would like to add some to their serving).  This dish was smashing with prime rib.  Joyeux Noel.....Sandra",12/27/2000 19:39:47,12/27/2000 19:39:47

I absolutely loved this soup when my husband and I would go to Famous Barr 30 years, when he was in the seminary at Concordia St. Louis.  I have made it through the years, because an aunt had sent me the recipe from her local Springfield, IL newspaper about 20 years.  Once I lost it, but a friend retrieved it for me from the time she had asked me for it.  What I love about your site is the instant way to double or triple or whatever the recipe!

As a matter of fact, a friend told me it was better than her friend's, who happens to be English.  I especially liked it because it did not call for a pudding mix, but rather a custard from scratch, which was as easy to make as from a box. It was not difficult to make at all.

477,1878,6164,Mini Ravindran,"Here is one more way of doing this and the same can also be used as an excellent 
accompaniment to any dish. 
Dice nearly 10-12 medium sized onions and keep aside. 
Take a half litre yoghurt container. 
Add half teaspoon salt and half teaspoon coriander powder to the same. 
Mix the ingredients well to get a smooth consistency. 
Now put the onions in this curd mixture.
Chop a bunch of green coriander leaves or parsley and add to this.
Leave it aside for 45 minutes for the flavours to set in.
Salt can be adjusted to individual preferences.
Enjoy with steamed rice, sandwiches, hot pita bread or even with pastas. 
This also goes well as a dip with fritters.

Hope you enjoy the same.

The recipe is dead easy and the results were surprisingly good. I would recommend this for a buffet at a party(with toothpicks for that 60's kitch feel). One adaptation I suggest is to increase the worcestershire and add cayenne or tabasco to taste, simmer the sauce without the meatballs, and barbecue some ribs using this as the barbecue sauce. Yum! Pass the cole slaw, please.",03/03/2001 15:30:30,03/03/2001 15:30:30

best chicken recipe I have ever made.  It was simple, smelled phenomenal while it was
baking, and had a perfect combination of sweet and spicy... one of my favorite flavor
combinations.  I made one substitution.  I used four boneless, skinless chicken breasts
instead of the six thighs (which I assumed had bones). I made the sauce just how it

You just use water. In the old days Spaetzles dough was made thinner and put on a cuttingboard then scraped into boiling water. It only takes a couple of minutes..less then 5, for Spaetzle to be done. I actually have a spaetzlesmachine where you fill in the dough and it comes out looking like spagetti, but you stir them up and they break a little, cookingtime is 2 minutes...once they boil take them out. Spaetzlesmachine is much like a potatoricer, there are places on the web where you can buy those. Thats authentic Spaetzle.

I figured at least a 1/2 hour, if not more time.  The recipe is very authentic though, and I usually make it with one less potato. The suggestion to have some oil in the pan before you pour the eggs is VERY important.  Thanks for the recipe!",06/11/2001 16:33:45,06/11/2001 16:33:45

1141,1878,10808,Jean Sheehan,"This is one of our family favourite ""onion"" chutneys which goes well only with tomato pilaf or coconut rice. It is also known as ""Hellflame""
or ""Devil Chutney""

1 medium onion
1 tsp  chillie powder
2 tsps  sugar
pinch  salt
1 tabsp lemon juice

In a liquidiser grind all ingredients to a smooth sauce. If too sweet adjust by adding more chillie powder. If too hot, add a bit more sugar. How easy  is that!
Another version of the above is to use only 1 tsp sugar and add 2 tsps sultanas. This makes it a thicker and darker sauce. Enjoy!

So, I made my meatballs (sometimes making them like normal meatballs, with breadcrumbs, etc., and sometimes just seasoning the beef, and rolling it into balls), and baked them uncovered in the oven.  I drain whatever oil is there, if any, cover with the pre-made sauce (simmered while the meatballs bake), and bake for another 30 minutes or so, to bake the sauce on.  One other variation of mine, is lemon pepper added to the meatballs, and to the sauce.  If I am out, I will just use lemon juice.

2951,604,15451,Hilda.,"Correction regarding Ingredients
 Although these are not true English muffins as you would buy in an English  Cake shop[You cannot get them this side of the Atlantic] I would use this recipe. there is however one serious flaw in it, half way through it states. Turn out the dough and knead for a minute or two and then cut with a glass. This is extremely dangerous as a few years ago I was doing just that when the glass shattered in my hand.

3143,810,14188,Ann Stone,These were really good. I used Crisco butter-flavored shortening. Baking time was longer than noted in recipe...could just be my old oven!,09/04/2001 17:35:05,09/04/2001 17:35:05

3194,1396,2781,Stephanie Penofsky,The turnovers are fantastic when warm. Even the rice is great just as a side dish.  I used a mixture of wild rice and regular long grain.,09/06/2001 16:14:45,09/06/2001 16:14:45
3217,246,7770,Marty Crowder,"Outstanding dip for chips, but especially broc and cauliflower...My co-workers got most of it, but not before I at least got a decent taste. Thanx for a great recipe !",09/06/2001 16:14:48,09/06/2001 16:14:48
3234,1485,14983,chris H 2,This was extremely easy.  I substituted green squash since it's growing wild in my garden.  I thought it was a little to sweat but others liked it that way.,09/07/2001 16:20:43,09/07/2001 16:20:43
3243,1136,16140,Norahs Girl,"This was very good,i did add more garlic and used Mexican style tinned tomatoes and added 2 finely chopped serano chillis.I also sprinkled a little cayenne pepper over the top as a garnish prior to putting in the oven.",09/07/2001 16:20:45,09/07/2001 16:20:45

3533,912,11688,MaryEllen,"It actually tastes like apple pie, but uses ingredients that you always have on hand so dessert can be made without going shopping.  
Also, it reminds me of my childhood when my Mother used to make this pie and serve it with
homemade ice cream.  Yummmmmmmmmm",09/15/2001 03:39:51,09/15/2001 03:39:51

3647,664,19351,Cindy3,"Given how long it takes to make Lasagna the traditional way, I thought this was a good alternative.  The noodles were not ""mushy"" as one rater suggested when it was cooked on high. (I have not tried to cook it on low, though.)  I did add 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper and 1/4 cup parmesan cheese to the recipe.  Great recipe for working moms.",09/18/2001 20:35:08,09/18/2001 20:35:08

3713,1253,13273,Andy Jewell,Pesto only really works with pine kernals (or as a last resort - walnuts) and you really need much more basil to get the true flavour,09/20/2001 22:48:18,09/20/2001 22:48:18

3781,932,10437,Joann Sklarsky,"I always mix my dressing ingredients together first before adding to the entire dish.  For instance mix the mayo, salt, pepper, horseradish together first in a small dish.  If you are usign small pieces of onion and celery too then add that in as well,  Then mix all of that with the potatoes.  It spreads all of the dressing ingredients better throughout the salad.  Tastes better faster.  Although it is always better to let it ""sit"" a bit before serving this helps speed up that process.",09/23/2001 20:58:51,09/23/2001 20:58:51

3813,693,13483,Tebo3759,"What a simple ""souper"" (no pun indended) dish.  I served this over rice with beans and cream corn on the side. Not an eligant dish but what a winner as an every day fast and easy dish.  It has may way to vary it.  I'll do it often",09/23/2001 20:58:52,09/23/2001 20:58:52

3872,1012,5060,Derf2440,"This is a good basic receipe, but the bake time is really far out.  My oven is tested to correct thermometer heat.The oven was preheated to 350 degrees and this ""cake"" was done after 45 minutes and brown too!!  1 1/4 hrs plus 10 minutes is 40 minutes too long!! Had I not been watching it, it would have been a disaster!! Having ignorned your time instructions, it actually turned out quite nice, but more like a pie than a cake. Will try it with peaches next time.",09/25/2001 19:16:15,09/25/2001 19:16:15

4094,102,18974,Jane Rudewick,"This is a wonderful recipe.  Easy to do, quick (if you use the oven method)and flavorful.  Can be adapted to things on hand.  A layer or two of sliced onions changes the taste.  Guests have requested this dish when they know I am cooking.  A keeper!",10/03/2001 16:39:12,10/03/2001 16:39:12
4132,451,13483,Tebo3759,Really very good but I might have goofed.  I cut the potatoes into 8 pieces and this might have been too  small as they cooked in half the time.  Also the coating mixture burned on the botton of the dish.  Maybe oven was too hot.  Will adjust next time.  But a great recipe.,10/05/2001 16:46:02,10/05/2001 16:46:02

4341,1881,11688,MaryEllen,"This recipe is almost exactly what my Grandmother called ""Boiled Cake"". 
She said it was originally ""made up"" because the ingredients for a regular cake were not
always available.  
This is one of my favorite cakes--great to take to a pot luck, or office party.  It tastes
wonderful, packs well and everyone loves it.
The only difference is she used lard, my mother substituted Crisco when they boiled the
sugar (they used white sugar), water, raisins, etc. together. And of course, they did not
always have nuts on hand so they were omitted a lot.
Wonderful cake!
Just a side effect -- when the mixture is boiling the entire house gets that spicy cooking
smell that brings the whole family into the kitchen saying ""what smells so wonderful).",10/15/2001 19:30:17,10/15/2001 19:30:17

(2) I was afraid there wouldn't be enough sauce, so I made 1-1/2 times the amount called for (i.e., 6 tbsp butter and flour, 3 c. milk, 1 can condensed chicken broth + 1 c. water, and I used 4 eggs) and I'm glad I did -- I used every bit. (3) The 15 min prep time listed is quite wrong...by the time I chopped the chicken, the broccoli, the onion, minced the garlic, grated the mozzarella, made the sauce ... well,you get the picture. It took me almost an hour to prepare. But it was well worth the effort and I will definitely make this again -- my family LOVED it.",10/28/2001 16:34:41,10/28/2001 16:34:41

Also, this ""cake"" (it's really more like a brownie) simply must have frosting.  While the marshmallows are toasting, melt 4 tablespoons of butter with 3 tablespoons cocoa.

I'm normally put off by so many ingredients, but it was really easy to assemble (and that didn't take nearly as long as bijoudog suggested). Our cilantro was a bit sad, so I used a combo of mint and parsley instead, and didn't put the carrots in it. I made this with prunes, apricots, and a few pieces of crystalised ginger for the fruit.
We had this over couscous with currants onions, and preserved lemon.",06/28/2002 00:31:30,06/28/2002 00:31:30

I used short grain brown rice, and while I was concerned that it would take longer to cook or be dry it was easily cooked in the hour and a half listed as the cooking time and wasn't in the least bit dry to my tastes.  Slicing intead of chopping the onions is a wonderful touch.  Onions are often slimy in recipes like this but these were perfect.
I only hade one problem in this recipe.  I cooked it uncovered and the tomatoes that were on top burned horribly.  They were inedible and I had to throw them out.  This wasn't too much of a problem for us since the dish was still excellent, and my husband and daughter aren't big tomato fans but I thought I'd mention it anyway.

I'm so glad there is vanilla in the recipe, it made them smell heavenly while baking and the vanilla and raisin flavors are fabulous! My only recommendations are to be sure and knead the dough a bit after adding the raisins (in step 5) before patting on your board. Also, I only got 7 scones out of the dough and I used every bit of it. I give this recipe an A plus and 2 thumbs up! You gotta try it with stawberry preserves and Devon cream. The best!

After the first batch I used a jelly-roll pan so the butter couldn't drip off.  There's no need to re-butter the pan after the first batch.  My hubby accidentally bought fat free cream cheese, which I thought would ruin them, but they turned out fine.  I found the phyllo dough web site to be of great help  www.athens.com  with folding the triangles.  Recipezaar had the better idea of cutting the 2"" strips before unrolling, though.  Make sure you keep any dough you're not immediately working with under a damp towel.  It will be ruined if you don't. ",12/16/2002 14:26:57,12/16/2002 14:26:57
34854,40,59064,Missy Wombat,"My favourite lemonade recipe is essentially the same as this. Allowing the sugar to absorb the lemon oils is what makes it so delicious. The syrup is quite concentrated so a little goes a long way. I usually use the zest of 4 lemons, their juice and 1 cup of boiling water and 1 cup sugar. It's good old fashioned lemonade.

38158,397,56718,Madi6156,"Great recipe but I will make some minor alterations in the cooking temperature and times next time I fix it.  The ingredients don't need to be altered, in my opinion, just the cooking directions.  I made two batches of biscotti, this recipe first and then a batch of lemon-ginger biscotti from the cookbook that came with my food processor.  I followed the directions exactly on both batches and this batch was overcooked for the first baking which made it to dry and it was very crumbly when i was trying to cut it before the second baking.  The other recipe didn't cook quite as long and at a lower temperature for the first baking and turned out beautiful--it looked like a professional had made it.  The alterations I will make are as follows:  For the first baking bake at 325 degrees for 22 minutes.  Remove from the oven cool only for 10 minutes and then cut at 1/2"" intervals (this made it easier to cut and each biscotti was perfectly shaped).  Arrange slices on the baking sheet (cut sides exposed) and bake for 20 to 25 minutes until they begin to turn golden and crispy.  I turned them once through that baking even though the recipe didn't require it.  Enjoy!!!",01/17/2003 17:57:24,01/17/2003 17:57:24

Here's a tip: make sure the oil is hot but not too hot, or else they might brown very dark real fast.  A way to tell if the oil is hot is to wet your figertips with water and splash the oil.  If it boils immediatly, then the oilis hot, and if it takes more than 3-6 seconds, then you should let it heat a little longer.  Good Luck and Enjoy!

The batter smells great, must be the cocoa-cinnamon combo, smelled great cooking too, now smells great sitting on the counter.  When I saw the batter, I decided to put it in a 9x13 pan, to make one large cake.  The result was great, even with all of these changes.

I used Marsala wine,a close cousin to sherry and marinated (after cooking ) the chicken for 2 days in the stock in the fridge.  Because I started with skinless/boneless breasts the stock did not gel but it will be used as a base for another soup.

I got nostalgic the other night, and decided that I wanted to make funnel cakes like the ones that I used to get at the fair as a kid.  I looked up this recipe.  The batter was way too thick, and wouldn't pass through my funnel, so I had to pour it from a cup, as thinly as possible.  It did not work very well, so I tried thinning the batter with a little extra milk.  That just seemed to make it thicker.  The 'cakes' turned out very thick and doughy.

66578,70,86318,mianbao,"I don't think anyone would have done it, but the preheating mentioned in step 1 is much too early. The dough mentioned in step 4 was a batter. So I added enough flour (5 1/2 more cups), extra salt (1 teaspoon) and some oil (1 tablespoon - just because) to make a kneadable dough. I continued from there, and got 2 medium loaves (620 g each) and 17 rolls at about 45 g (1 1/2 oz) each. What can I say? The bread is delicious, but it's not really the bread of this recipe. And I'm not sure what the buckwheat flour contributes - maybe some texture, not much flavor what with the caraway seeds. We will eat the bread and enjoy it, but I don't think I'll try this again.

I put the chicken into a ziplock bag poured in the sake and massaged it into the  chicken through the bag. let it rest for 30 minutes and found there was none left to drain off. I mixed the dry spices (used  1  1/2 tsp paprika - amt not  given in the recipe) in another zip lock bag added the chicken and tossed until all the pieces were evenly coated. Instead of deep frying I pan fried the chicken in 3 tbsp oil - fantastic, crunchy on the outside and moist inside.  The flavor is very mildly curry but unless you knew it was in there you would be guessing. It is a lovely combination of flavors and will not bite you.

I took Lennie's advice and made 1 1/2 times the amount of sauce.  It was about the perfect amount. I also added about twice the amount of minced garlic to the chicken cubes for extra flavor.

We LOVE cheese so I used about 1 1/2 cups, shredded Mozzarella (1/2 lb), as follows: I used more Mozza cheese than called for in the cottage cheese mixture, and put some on top of the zucchini prior to putting it in the oven. The rest of the cheese was used on top at the 10-minute marker. This is an excellent recipe and the timing of the baking stages is bang on! Next time, I'm going to add spinach to the cottage cheese mixture - seems a natural! ",02/17/2004 02:02:01,02/17/2004 02:02:01

They flattened right out, and stuck to the pan after 6 1/2 minutes. But while I was scraping them off the pan, I ate a few, and they were very tasty. I added a bit more flour before baking the second batch and that helped them keep their shape a bit better. Also baked them for 6 minutes only. I might try this again and use a whole cup of flour and refrigerate the dough before baking to see if that helps them not to flatten out so much. ",03/09/2004 03:20:18,03/09/2004 03:20:18

I do not have egg rings so I took a juice can and with tin snips cut off the bottom part of the can and the top discarding the middle part of the tin.  Remove bottom lid before cutting the can, you get two rings from each can. When the surface of the crumpet was covered with holes I removed the rings let them cooked a couple of minutes longer and then  flipped the crumpet over for abouta half minute.  Lovely toasted lathered in butter and some honey on top. I will post a further picter of the toasted crumpet later. Thanks Doreen Randal great recipe",06/18/2004 19:47:53,06/18/2004 19:47:53

I added 1 T lemon juice and instead of sugar, went with 3/4 c Splenda (we like it sweet).  I didn't add any water at all, and I'm glad I didn't because there was enough lodged in the apples themselves to produce a great sauce consistency.

When I shook my potatoes in the Ziploc mixture, mostly the flour and only a small amount of parsley and cheese clung to the potato slices. I was thinking to myself, ""now what do I do with all of my expensive, freshly grated parmesan,"" which was still in the bottom of my bag. So, I sort of heaped the remaining cheese mixture onto the tops of the potatoes in the baking dish. Once flipped over at mid-point of cooking time, the cheese, now on the bottom, formed a hard, baked crust that wasn't really very good. I will say, though, that the potatoes smelled Grreaat! while baking. It does seem worth it to try the recipe w/o the flour, so I can really get the cheese on there.

(I also didn't use sesame, just forgot :)) For some reason it got to stay in the marinade for 48 hrs. I used half of one side of salmon, but the same amount of marinade. It looked quite impressive when it came out of the pan. If you just use pieces of salmon filet, you might want use 2 per person, because you will come back for more. I served it with rice and a corn-cucumbersalsa. It's easy and quick to make and will be eaten by todlers too.

I fried the bacon first.  Using the same skillet, I then melted butter in a tiny bit of leftover bacon fat and tossed the bread cubes in that, then used the same skillet to brown the hamburger.  I mixed the tomatoes and vegetables (frozen corn and black beans) right in the skillet after draining the hamburger fat, then began layering in a casserole dish: meat, rice, crumbled bacon, grated cheddar.  Two layers.  (No breadcrumbs yet.)  Covered with foil and baked at 350 for 30 minutes.  Uncovered, put on bread and passed under the broiler until the topping was golden and crunchy.  The result was a really lovely casserole - and I mean that literally - very pretty presentation!  It tasted so good; there isn't a bit left over. The bacon adds a lot, and the crispy bread cubes are great.  The only suggestion at the table was from my husband who likes things a little spicier.

135825,246,142790,rememberingraven,"This was a pretty good dip, but I find that it is lacking something and I just don't know what. The tangy/sour flavor from the cream cheese,sour cream and lemon juice was certainly overpowering the whole dip. It needed something with a spicy taste, I think, to balance the flavor. Also, The cheese I had melted on top(cheddar) had a layer of oil from cooking.After it had cooled a little the whole top layer of cheese came off in one piece. Maybe next time (if I remake it)I will mix all the cheese in to the main mix. Other than those small flaws it was edible and the flavor of the crab meat really came through.",11/25/2004 21:38:46,11/25/2004 21:38:46

139127,198,37106,Just Cher,I apologize for taking so long to review this recipe as I have made this now at least 3 times. I did make some changes but only because we like our soup not quit as thick as what this recipe calls for. Therefore I used 4 tbs of cornstarch and 2 eggs. I did not think that the chili sauce needed to be adjusted. We all agreed that it had just the right amount of heat. My daughter enjoys this so much that she now fixes a big pot of it on the weekends (minus all the meat and veggies) and eats it for lunch through out the week.

I absolutely love this sauce recipe.  I have been using it almost every week since my first time and look forward to my homemade pizza like never before...because it tastes so good.  I especially love combining this sauce with Culinary Judge's #51209 dough, which has also become my favorite.  It is so very easy and so very good.  The only changes I make is that I always use twice as much water as the recipe calls for and 2 or 3 times as much fresh parmesan cheese.  I let the sauce simmer while I make the dough which creates a lot of heavenly flavor in the sauce.  If you haven't tried this sauce please do...I promise you won't regret it.  I'm hoping this recipe gets more exposure...it should have many, many more reviews! It is wonderful! It  definitely should be a  keeper in everyone's cookbook who loves pizza.

155534,2047,39547,Julesong,"I made this for my husband because he loves spicy foods and jerk seasoning.  We used chicken breasts and thighs.  Instead of broiling or roasting, however, I sauteed the breasts - when they were about 3/4 done in the pan, I added about 1/3 cup of sherry to aid in the cooking/browning.  When the breasts were firm, and I removed them from the pan, I added about another 1/4 cup of sherry to deglaze the pan. When it made a nifty sauce, I poured it over the breasts.  Steingrim *really* liked the sauce, and said it was sort of like a ""sherry pepper"" flavor, which is popular in Caribbean cooking.  The allspice made all the difference in this recipe, in my opinion - don't skip it!  An *excellent* recipe, well worth 5 stars.

It's tasteless without a lot of salt.  My DH thought it was okay.  I did change the recipe a little, though, to make it a bit easier. 1) To shorten the amount of cooking time, I pricked each potato a few times with a fork, and then microwaved them between two moist paper towels for about 6-8 minutes, or until starting to get soft.  I cut them into chunks (using a pot holder, of course).  I always leave the skin on as it doesn't take away from the taste and does add a little nutrition.  2) I didn't clean the pan between cooking the potatoes and onions and cooking it with the eggs and I had no problem.  I did add about 2 Tbsp. of oil first, though.  3) I added about 1 1/2 - 2 tsp. of salt.  4) I added some sliced scallions/green onions for color.  5) I cooked the omelet on high and waited a few minutes so that I only had to cook each side once.

The complexity of the flavors and the perfect amount of spiciness made me go back for more after I had already eaten a lot. I don't particularly like raisins but they added a nice sweet flavor and a cool texture to the dish. We didn't have pappadams - we served this with a lightly curried rice.

It worked, but I think maybe a bit more dough would have been helpful.  2) there definitely was not enough preserves (at least not in my opinion).  I used about 4 more ounces of preserves in order to get a nice layer over the bars.  I did feel as though there was a bit too much meringue, so I left off just a tad bit of it.  Overall, this recipe is fantastic, and they make for fabulous crowd pleasers.  I finished these minutes before my guests arrived, and they were gone before I knew it...

If you want a spectacular looking dessert to impress someone, this is it!  Wonderful layers of cake, strawberries and pastry cream all topped with whipped cream and drizzled with raspberry sauce.  The trifle was very good and the only complaint we had was that it wasn’t quite as sweet as we would have liked it to be.  After talking with Julesong about this recipe, in the future I’ll add a small amount of sugar to the strawberries before layering.

My only complaint is I found the term ""batter"" to be misleading. I would describe it more as ""crumbs"". This wasn't a problem when making the crust, you just press them into the pan, but it did make it difficult to prepare the lattice top. Next time I would either add a small amount of water to the reserved crumbs to form more of a pastry dough before rolling out or just sprinkle the crumbs on top. I also noticed they tasted better and were moister the second day so I would recommend baking them the day before you are going to serve them. ",04/04/2005 17:47:38,04/04/2005 17:47:38

172141,375,133174,PaulaG,"I tagged this recipe knowing that it was one of your adoptees and you hadn't made it yet.  I would never have made this as written.  It is my belief, and only my belief, veggies in a frittata should be crisp tender.  Hope you don't mind that I took some liberty with this recipe.  I sliced the squash thin and added some green onions and red bell pepper.  Cooked the onion and bell pepper for a few minutes in a lightly buttered cast iron skillet, added the squash and cooked to wilt.  Poured the eggs mixture of egg substitute mixed with 1 tablespoon crème fraiche, black pepper and Italian seasoning over the veggies.  Cooked, lifting egg to allow the uncooked portion to go to the bottom of the pan.  When eggs were almost set, I topped them off with freshly grated parmesan cheese and placed under the broiler for a few minutes to melt the cheese.  The family enjoyed this served with fresh biscuits.",05/05/2005 13:09:27,05/05/2005 13:09:27

I think that using a food processor to finely chop the almonds could be a good idea. If you don't chop them finely enough, they won't stick well.

The marinade could use some more flavor. I think that some minced green onion and garlic would help. And freshly ground black pepper.

I made a couple subs and used whole wheat pastry flour instead of unbleached, wheat bran instead of oat bran, sucanat instead of sugar, 1 egg and half an egg's worth of soyflour egg substitute instead of just whites and walnuts instead of pecans.  I didn't find these to have the rubbery texture that low-fat baked goods so often have and they're really dark and chocolatey.  The bran, I think, gave it a nice lighter texture, and kept it from being too dense.

178587,524,65056,Roosie,"I made this with fresh organic apricots that were too tart to eat out of hand and it turned out wonderfully.  You can really taste the apricots and all the flavors are very well-balanced.  I actually made this as a loaf, rather than muffins (by the way, just to note, 6 jumbo muffins should equal 12 regular-sized muffins, so I think that Dorel was mistaken in that respect).  It turned out with a lovely cake-like crumb, dense and moist.  I was surprised that the recipe instructed to add the apricot so early- most baked good recipes call for any fruit added to be added at the very end so that the fruit isn't broken down.  I think the fact that the apricots were added earlier and mashed a little as I mixed in the other ingredients made the bread moister and infused the whole thing with more apricot flavor.  I made a few subs- I used whole wheat pastry flour rather than all-purpose, sucanat rather than white sugar and butter instead of shortening.  I didn't find it at all too sweet, especially with the fresh apricots which are much less sweet than dried.  I really liked the flavor/texture that the walnuts added.  Just a really lovely bread.

By making a ""starter"" in which wild yeast can grow, the sourdough baker can raise bread naturally, as mankind did for thousands and thousands of years before a packet of yeast was an available convenience at the local market. Not all sourdough is sour-tasting; Amish Friendship Bread and other types of live-yeast breads are also sourdough.

To become a sourdough baker, all you need are some basic ingredients (flour, water, salt, and sugar), some basic tools (a mixing bowl, an oven, and a baking sheet), and a basic interest. If you can make bread, you can make sourdough bread.",06/23/2005 05:06:20,06/23/2005 05:06:20

183419,264,224832,Kishawnya,"I would just like to remind those believing this to be vegan, that it is infact not. Well, everything on the recipe IS vegan, aside for the granulated sugar. 

Any sugar that isn't directly from the Sugar Cane itself and untreated (such as Succanat, or other natural sugars such as Agave Necter) are 100% NON-VEGAN. 

Granulated sugar is made with ground animal bones. The animal bones are almost completely incinerated to leave active carbon, which is used to remove colour from the raw cane sugar; thus making it WHITE. Giving it the ""bleached"" look.

Suprisingly enough, not many people know this.. infact, the majority of VEGANS I meet know nothing of this. But I hope it helps! 

I would suggest substituting the granulated sugar for things like natural honey, agave necter or succanat. These are all extremely healthy substitues that still taste great. 

Infact, out of all the alternatives I listed, 100% natural/organic and unprocessed Honey is incredibly healhty for you, it has countless health benefits, so much that I doubt it would fit here! lol!

Do yourselves a favor and do a little research, find out which form of sweetening is best for you!

I let it sit for a day and it didn't seem any better, so I covered it with frosting and voila, the third day it was moist, dense and delicious, the kind of thing you can't resist taking a chunk of every time you pass the pan sitting on the counter. So the moral is to get it frosted right away and let it mellow for a day, then dig in. I used a vegan ""cream cheese ""frosting and it was delicious. The caramel frosting above sounds even better.

The resulting hybrid recipe (for split chicken breasts cooked over an open apple-wood fire) was the absolute best grilled chicken, ever... anywhere. My guests were awestruck. Here's my modified ingredients:
2 dried red smoked chilies; 3 cloves fresh garlic; 3 oz. A-1 Sauce; 2 Tbsp. Fresh Rosemary (instead of sage); 2 Tbsp. cracked black pepper; 1 cup vodka; 1 1/2 c. apple juice; 1/2 c. lemon juice (bottled); 3 Tbsp. regular Olive oil; 3 oz. Maggi Seasoning sauce. I liquefied all the ingredients in my food processor and marinated for 4 hours, grilled the stuff over the open fire/coals and, WOW!

Being unfamiliar with Thai cooking, part of the problem may lie with me.  I did not know for how long to soak my mushrooms, so they may not have soaked long enough before I had to add them to the dish.  At this time, the recipe does not indicate how much or what type of oil to use for cooking the shallots and garlic.  I started with sesame oil and then re-cooked shallots in vegetable oil and combined the two oils when I tossed and coated the noodles.  I still don't think I had enough oil to properly coat the noodles, and by this time it was too late to try and flavor my third round of oil, as my meat was all cooked and waiting for my noodles to be added.

This recipe is one that can be very versatile, and I can see making it with other combinations such as feta with oregano & kalamata olives or asiago with basil and garlic.

I put everything in the crockpot the night before (except the pasta) to simplify the cooking, and so I didn’t have to worry about the vegetables being overdone.

Yeah, your hand will get gloppy, but it's kind of fun to mush it up.  Very light and fluffy inside, nice crispy outside, perfect texture and flavor.  I was thinking of using butter flavored crisco, but I used plain instead and am happy with that choice.  I also cut the salt to 1 tsp.  I made 6 good size biscuits.

I had trouble getting the chicken to brown like I wanted (perhaps because I sprayed it with olive oil in a Misto sprayer instead of drizzling with butter), so I ended up cooking it a bit longer, resulting in slightly-too-dry chicken tenders. This was purely my fault, though. For the sauce, I used a sauce intended for coconut shrimp that uses orange marmalade, dijon mustard, and honey, from recipe # 9061. Simply heavenly with the chicken!

Oh and no sugar, just 1.5 tsp sweet n low. And used NF dry milk and water instead of regular milk - probably about 1.5 cups - one cup just wasn't nearly enough. The muffins are great - rose very nicely. I make muffins pretty often - nice when bread is running low and to use up fruit (like bananas) that are starting to go. Great recipe, very easy to adapt.

237093,1465,271221,Big Bill in Big D,"I have never considered raisin pies among my favorites -- until now! When I learned we had three unopened boxes of raisins in the cupboard I decided to give it a try and take it to a covered dish dinner tonight. I read most of the recipes and decided on this one primarily because it incorporat ed orange juice, orange zest and cinnamon, which were unique to this recipe. The result was outstanding with just enough tartness to make a big difference from most other recipes -- it even garnered praise from people who didn't like raisin pie! The results belie the ease of preparation. Definitely a repeater. Too bad we aren't allowed a sixth star!

One comment -- I was fearful the finished product would be too watery so I poured off most of the unabsorbed liquid after plumping the raisins. Next time I will include all the liquid.

We started with fresh spinach, so we added them to the onion together with the garlic and cooked them for a few minutes, until done. Then we let the mixture cool, salted it a little bit, but not too much since we  used 2/3 cup goat milk feta and added about 3 tbsp grated pecorino romano in step 2. We also used more  garlic (6 cloves, finely chopped)and shrimps (9 ounces frozen, then thawed a steamed and cut them into 1/2"" pieces) and added a lightly beaten egg to the filling (even though I'm not sure it's essential ; I just did it because I usually do when I make spanakopita).

I followed the recipe but because I was only making two slices of toast for breakfast just grilled the capsicum under a sandwich press (skin down) and did the toast the same way but made into fingers with the crust intact. I took the photograph before adding the lime, it made a great start to the day! It would also be a good picnic / camping type dish that you could spread just before eating.

We used half whole wheat and half white flour.  That seems to be a perfect mix.  Used half of the dough for a pizza and the other half a couple days later for calzones.  The sauce was great.  We used wine and added a dash of garlic powder.  Topped the pizza with veggie pepperoni, onions, baked garlic, spinach and cheese.  Next time I think that we will cook the crust a few minutes before topping it.  Thanks for sharing this recipe- this is the best completly home made pizza we have made.

Tortillas get nice and crispy on top. Couldn't taste the ginger, so it could easily be omitted. The cooking time was a bit short for me: the peaches weren't soft enough and the liquid didn't thicken up, but the top tortilla strips would have burned if I'd cooked it any longer. Would suggest another frozen fruit like blackberries, canned peaches or precooking the fruit part before adding the top layer of tortilla strips. A nice healthy and light dessert.

-I prepared it just as posted and it was fantastic. 
-For a vegan alteration: I doubled the amount of tomatoes and olives (using kalamata in addition to the green). We didn't even miss the feta, but I found that it could be sprinkled over or mixed into the salad at the time of serving and it was even more delicious.

I omitted the bay leaf, caramel color, and the white wine because I did not have them on hand.  I used a homemade French baguette sliced and dried out in at 250 degrees in the oven for about 15 minutes.  I then added monzarella cheese on top and toasted until the cheese was bubbly and slightly browned.  I then added the bread to the bowls of hot soup.  
I do not own any oven crocks that I could have broiled the bread and cheese in, but making the cheese toast separately worked really well for me.  I also used the Swanson's broth.  With the Swanson's Broth the color was right on, so I am not sure if the caramel color is really even necessary.

Everyone kept saying how wonderful this was. Needless to say it went fast. I doubled the ingredients to make twice as much and all the measurements worked fine. I did add a little more cheddar cheese to the dip...just about 2 more TBSP because I love cheese and apparently so does everyone else. This is definitely a keeper.

However, the pasta turned mushy after several hours. There is not a lot of it, though, so it didn't ruin the whole soup. I would use a slight less bit of tabasco than 3/4 tsp unless you like it really hot. This soup is even better the next day!  Very yummy comfort food !!!",12/04/2006 09:02:54,12/04/2006 09:02:54

351690,76,59064,Missy Wombat,I unfortunately couldn't get enthused about this alfredo sauce despite its numerous wonderful reviews. This alfredo is too heavy and stodgy for my tastes which is probably due to the huge amount of butter in this recipe. The recipe I am used to uses the same amount of cream but only a couple of tablespoons of butter and a third of the cheese. It just didn't have that lightness that makes a nice creamy alfredo perfect for me :(.,12/28/2006 09:49:40,12/28/2006 09:49:40

Served it with an assortment of crackers and some tortilla chips. It was a big hit with my family.

The date amount was dropped to between 2 and 3 ozs and they were not boiled but chopped and added. The cola became Diet Cherry Vanilla Coke and it was used cold. The brown sugar became 1/3 cup of Splenda.The extracts were 1/2 tsp each of vanilla and cherry and I skipped the nuts. Even with these changes it's wonderful in flavor and light and very tender inside. I will use an 8x4"" pan next time I make this as it didn't get very high in the 9x5 I used. I find it plenty sweet enough with the drastic cut in the dates and sugar. I don't even want to imagine how sweet it would be in the original form.

The bars have a chewy ""crust"" that mixes well with the melted chocolate chips and vanilla glaze.  It is an easy recipe.  I mixed everything by hand (with a wooden spoon) and had no trouble with lumps etc. I did not have crunchy style peanut butter, so I used creamy peanut butter instead.  Next time (and there will be a next time!) I'll make sure to have crunchy peanut butter.

I prepared the zest of one orange - which is the finely grated peel, and added it as the recipe called for in #2 of the instructions.  Then I noticed it mentioned juice in line #3 which made sense because after adding the dry ingredients the batter was much thicker than a cupcake batter should be.  I then added the juice from the orange I used for zest.  I don't think it affected the end product much though and it had a very nice orange flavor.  Incidentally, one batch equalled 12 cupcakes for me.  I will probably try again using juice instead of zest and most likely double the recipe.",01/29/2007 22:34:09,01/29/2007 22:34:09

The house smells wonderful and homey and the taste just quietly explodes in your mouth as you taste all the flavors and the textures. I cut the sugar to 1 1/3 cups for dietary reasons and it came out fabulous.  All else was followed as you wrote.  I cooked for 95 minutes at 325, (time probably increased due to the -25 degrees outside) The tops were crunchy and the inside was moist and delicious.

Couple of additions I made - after melting the butter I put a spoonful of garlic in and before adding the milk I put a dash of sherry in. Also didn't use canned pimiento as I couldn't find it in my loca store.

As for the sauce, I doubled the amounts for the sauce and it came out much better (go figure).  Wonderful recipe...highly recommended!!",02/27/2007 16:37:12,02/27/2007 16:37:12
378992,689,332282,esrgirl,DH and I really enjoyed this fish.  The only substitution I made was due  to another reviewer's suggestion- I didn't have any lemon so I used Old Bay seasoning and I spritzed the tops of the fish with cooking spray.  This turned out great.  It was crunchy and flaky.  I highly recommend it.,02/27/2007 19:25:16,02/27/2007 19:25:16

379975,1832,383557,Bruce Benjamin,"I made this last night and it was very good.  I've been using the same Kung Pao recipe for years and this was a nice change.  I didn't follow the recipe exactly though. I marinated the chicken as directed but I changed the veggies.  Same amount but I added zucchini and left out the celery.  I used a little less green pepper and a little more onion.  I didn't have any hot peppers on hand so I left them out and made up for the volume with the zucchini.  Today I found some fresh water chestnuts at the store and bought those.  You have to peel them and they aren't nearly as cheap as the ones in a can but they are so much better.  They are sweet and juicy and to me they taste almost exactly like jicama.  Sort of a cross between a potato and an apple.  I'll use these some time this weekend for another Chinese dish.

The veggies aren't really what a Kung Pao recipe is about anyway.  It's about the sauce and the chiles.  This is what attracted me to this recipe out of the many that are on this website.  I doubled the amount.  Otherwise I made it pretty much to spec but when I tasted it before adding to the dish it was way too strong for my tastes.  I'm quite used to flavor-packed Asian dishes, especially Thai and Indian curries.  But I've ordered this dish in restaurants many times and I thought the sauce was just too intense.  So I thinned it a bit with some chicken stock and then added corn starch to help it thicken.  I probably added 2/3 cup, give or take.  It was still full of flavor and tasted about right.  I also added some Thai chile garlic sauce to the sauce mix for more heat and chile flavor.  This recipe usually has dried red chiles, (whole) added to the hot oil before adding the chicken and you cook until the chiles just start to brown.  Leave them in for a dramatic effect but warn your guests that they aren't really good to eat.  I suppose you can eat them but they're really just dry and nearly burned.  

 I used crushed red peppers,(out of whole dried peppers too) several cloves of garlic and 1 or 2 tablespoons of minced ginger to the oil before cooking the chicken. Adding ginger and garlic to the hot oil is pretty common with Chinese stir fried dishes and really adds great flavor to the meat.  

As I said, Kung Pao is mostly about the sauce and the chiles.  I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because I really think it needs to be diluted a bit to make it more authentic.  Chicken stock is perfect for this but you'll want to add a little corn starch, maybe a couple of tablespoons, so that it will thicken when you cook it.  Good stuff and I'll be making it again for sure.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

380279,62,56061,Akikobay,"We liked this recipe a lot because it's very flavorful.  As I've had a chance to adjust the recipe to our taste, it's evolved into something that we enjoy often.  We substitute lime juice for the lemon juice and significantly increase the amount.  I use frozen corn and instead of the fresh parsely leaves I use a lot of cilantro.  As mentioned by another reviewer, I throw in a good pinch of sea salt.  Usually, I substitute a finely minced red onion for the scallion.  I also find that the flavors in this salad improve greatly as it sits, so I try to make it the evening before we want to eat it.  This is a staple at our house!

Since this pie had so many great reviews, I thought it would be a great way to put the remaining amount to use.  I followed the recipe as written, although I reduced the amount of sugar to 1 cup as was suggested by other reviewers.  This 'pie' turned out incredibly greasy and relatively tasteless.  The consistency of the filling is very mushy and does not match well with the flakiness of the crust.

I added 1/2 tsp of salt to the dry ingredients, based some of the other reviewers' suggestions. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla to the wet ingredients because I love the flavor. I said ""Oh wow"" when I bit into the first one. They're very flavorful, and healthier than your typical muffin. In my opinion, they taste better than ones made with white flour and sugar. I decided to check them after 20 minutes because 30 sounded long to me, and I'm really glad I did because they were just right.

417972,1005,108043,Bev erly,"I made this pizza dough today and am immediately reviewing it because it is the BEST and easiest dough to prepare.  I followed the dough recipe but used olive oil and all bread flour.  I kneaded the dough in my Kitchen Aid and was a little skeptical cause it seemed like the dough was a little heavy.  I thought I should have used less flour but it was perfect.  The bread flour makes for a very tender crust and this recipe does not disappoint.  I also baked one pizza on my pizza oven (the rotating one) and one in the oven. PERFECT! This truly is a recipe worth trying and keeping.  I also found out that this dough does refrigerate very well so it can be made in advance and just taken out of the fridge for the second rising.  It is also best to let the dough rest for a few minutes after putting on pan before putting on the ingredients.  Thanks for the great recipe.  I did not use the recipe for sauce as I had my own.  It looks like a good basic pizza sauce recipe, which I know will not disappoint. You will never have to buy tough crust with this recipe so easily made!",05/20/2007 20:26:18,05/20/2007 20:26:18

A tip for Chewy cookies:
Reduce the heat to 360 (even 350 depending on your oven) and cook for 12-14 min (I used a tablespoon to drop on the sheets so my cookies were a little bigger).  Cool on the pan for 3-4 min before putting them on the rack. I cool them another 10 min or so before putting them in the cookie jar and they are still nice and chewy.

I baked them for 30 minutes at about 375F (sorry, forgot to make a note of the temperature, so no guarantees) and they came out delicious.

I accidentally put in 1/2 c. oil, and also due to personal preference, I did end up altering almost everything, but I still feel this recipe, as stated, will be wonderful.  For pref., I used whole eggs, brown sugar instead of honey, added 1/2 t. salt and 1 t/ vanilla, and was short 1/4 c. blueberries, so added 1/3 c. fresh cranberries.  For the buttermilk, I used Saco dried (5 T. plus 1 1/4c. water.)  Because I accidentally added too much oil, I added extra flour and a bit of extra soda.  With the extra, I got 15 muffins, and baked them about 25 minutes.  I also sprinkled just a bit of sugar on the top.  We all loved them!  Next time, I may stick closer to the recipe, except use applesauce instead of oil, and for personal pref. I will probably still use brown sugar.

I used the Most Incredible No Fail Pie Crust Recipe #28943 and it was terrific with this pie.

456870,155,468351,Olive,"This was a nice cold soup....easy enough to make. I added some garlic and used a shallot instead of the regular onion. I also used regular sour cream for more flavor and a creamier texture. 

The soup tasted better to me the second day. I would suggest chilling it overnight instead of the 8 hours because it gives the soup more time for the flavors to marinate together, thus bringing out the full flavor of the soup.",08/01/2007 22:51:35,08/01/2007 22:51:35

I thought about putting an icing on it but it doesn't need one (sweet enough).  Maybe cream cheese? I used orange juice instead of milk but i don't think I needed to, it's pretty orangey (but I have great tangy oranges).  Hubby liked it so much he cut HUGE pieces (I also doubled the recipe).

457563,947,551556,Kirsten E.,"These are fabulous! The only changes I made were I used all organic ingredients and added 1/3 c. sunflower seeds, used homemade sour milk for the buttermilk, and 1/2 c. butter instead of the shortening so there was no need for adding extra butter to the finished product. I also sprinkled some sugar on top before I baked them, so they came out just like the ones at the bakery. My kids loved these, we had them for breakfast with fresh oranges.

466132,280,557801,SrtaMaestra,"I've made a very similar recipe from an authentic source in the high school Spanish classes that I teach.  Tips:  First, just use ordinary olive oil, not an extra virgin, as if won't be able to take the heat.  To avoid crispy potatoes, be sure the oil is at the right temperature (potatoes should cook slowly when dropped in, and shouldn't sound like french fries in a deep frier) and that potatoes are sliced equally thin (my students do this with a mandoline).  My recipe also includes some garlic, which we crush and sautee with the onions in a separate pan just to make things easier (and to give another student a job to do).  The potatoes should NOT be stireed, as they tend to break up and release more starch this way.  One at a time (employ the assistance of another pair of hands to speed this up if you're not cooking alone) is the best way to go.  Keep in mind, you want evenly tender, cooked potatoes.  No browning.  These aren't french fries!  I'm not sure 1 cup of oil is enough.  We don't usually measure, just fill a skillet almost 1/2 full with olive oil, heat, and then put in potatoes as long as they are all covered , so you don't have to stir.  One reviewer mentioned needing a lot of salt.  I had this problem the first time I made it in class as well.  I had skipped a step in my recipe, which recommends salting the potatoes before cooking, along with seasoning the egg with a little salt and pepper.  This really helps a lot, as salting afterwards just doesn't seem to do it.  The salt doesn't penetrate, and you end up with a really salty outside & lack of flavor inside.  If done correctly, the tortilla should only be flipped once.  High heat when you first drop the egg mixture into the pan is important, as in the original recipe.  This helps to avoid sticking.  However, I don't know that I'd go all the way to the smoking point.  Do reduce the heat and allow to cook slowly right after putting the eggs and potatoes into the pan.  Frequent shaking really isn't necessary.  Just run a rubber scraper around the edge and give it a good shake to loosen before you do the famous ""flip.""  When the outside edges start to look dry and only the middle looks slightly runny, it's about time to flip.  I'm generally not a big fan of browned eggs, but in this dish, it's necessary and normal for the outside to brown, and no, it doesn't taste like an overcooked dry omlette.  This is totally different!  Yes, you can do the flip!  The first time I did it was in front of 20 teenagers, and I managed it!  The method in the recipe works well, but as you slide back into the pan, have a rubber scraper ready to tuck any potatoes that try to escape back into the eggs.  In Spain, this is served cut into wedges, either hot or cold, and yes, often in sandwiches.  I had never had leftovers to sample cold until this past semester, and WOW, is that good!  The most amazing part of this dish is that I always have students who don't like one or more of the ingredients, but somehow, the combination of all of them ends up creating something that appeals to nearly everyone.  I've only come across one high school student who did not like the dish, and everyone at least tries it.  (They're teenagers, they can't NOT try it!)  We didn't do anything other than pour excess oil out of the pan in between steps, there was no need to clean the pan.  The oil from frying the potatoes can be poured back into the bottle when cooled and stored in the refrigerator for future frying uses.  It will solidify in the refrigerator, but don't be alarmed.  It's still useable and will return to liquid form at room temperature.  Enjoy your tortilla espanola!  It IS a lot of work, but the flavor is worth the effort!  This is the minimalist, traditional recipe.  Once you master it, have fun with it and add whatever you want.  I won't tell the Spaniards you aren't making it the 'traditional' and 'authentic' way!  :)",08/21/2007 02:40:05,08/21/2007 02:40:05

469194,220,185926,Nado2003,"YUMMY.  I followed the recipe, except I ran out of sugar after 1 cup, so I substituted about half a cup of brown sugar for the rest. I baked it in a bundt pan for 50 minutes.  But next time I will reduce the time a little bit because I think I might have dried it out a little.  Maybe I should have taken it out of the oven at about 45 minutes when the toothpick inserted came out a little messy and let it finish off outside of the oven. It smelled great while baking and I could not wait to try it.  I love it.  I am eating it so fast, I am almost choking.  This is like a chocolate cake with zucchinis.  I grated the zucchinis by hand and did not wring out the moisture.  Next time I may add a cup of golden raisins because I think it would complement the taste.

I loved the flavor and the ease with which the dish goes together.

I followed the ingredient list to a T ... with the exception of the technique of cooking the potatoes. I already had baked potatoes in the fridge I needed to use up, so I chopped those up , mashed 'em a little with a fork , and I didn't press the mixture through a sieve. 

So, although the texture was undoubtedly different , the taste was what it was supposed to be , and it's great! 

A definite repeat at our house!

476074,686,97895,Pierre Dance,"I had just bought a little 2 quart slow cooker and have been busy trying it out on all manner of sauces and small quantity entrees.
It has proved to be extremely handy, a good addition to my kitchen. There are numerous recipes where the 6 quart crock pot is simply too big. This recipe was the perfect size for my new toy.
The only changes I made were to decrease the sugar to 1/3 cup and increase the soy sauce to 1/3 cup.
I was looking for a little less sweet and a little more sour.
I didn't have any tapioca so I thickened it with a bit of corn starch.
I served it in a bed of white basmati rice.
It well met my expectations.

I did salt the meat sauce while cooking which brought out the flavor more and lightly seasoned the zucchini slices with salt and pepper. Like another reviewer said, I sliced the zucchini lengthwise to have more of the appearance of noodles.

But as many of the five star reviews point out, it does need a little tweaking.  The flavor is bland, next time I will add some vanilla and increase the salt a little.  Also, the batter is too thick, needing more milk.  I used peanut oil to fry them since it has a higher smoking point than vegetable oil, and I mixed the ingredients together in the blender.  I used a ziplock bag with a corner cut out for pouring as there was no way the batter was going through my 1/4"" funnel.

Next time I'll knead it as little as possible to make it a bit fluffier, and maybe see what happens if I don't let it sit for the 10 minutes before baking, because the crust was pretty dry, and maybe not doing that might have an affect.

I knew it was going to be hard to roll, so I just went ahead and used my finger to press it into the pie plate in pieces after rolling it out to get it to the right thickness. It worked really well and the crust did come out flaky. My only real complaint was that it was much too salty for me. Next time I would cut the salt to 1/2 tsp. It did get better after a couple of days in the fridge.",10/25/2007 05:04:07,10/25/2007 05:04:07

I have never made stuffed green peppers homemade before, only had them from the freezer section (I think it was Stouffer's brand, name's not coming to me now, it's been a long time).  They were really good, but they also had ground beef in them, so I stopped buying them.  I chose this recipe because it sounded like it would taste the way I like my stuffed peppers to taste and I really wanted stuffed peppers.  I replaced the ground beef with ground turkey for my diet), used sweet onions, and instead of garlic salt, used garlic powder.  I also added some worcestershire sauce in with the browning meat, as well as later on.  When I cooked the meat, onions, and celery, I also added about one tsp of jarred, minced garlic.  I followed the rest of the recipe as stated.  I thought the times, ingred ratios, and cooking temp for this recipe were right on.  Everything cooked up perfectly and the taste was fantastic.  My bf wanted cheese on his, and all we had was a Mexican-blend cheese, so at the 5 min uncovered oven time, I sprinkled some cheese on his share.  I can't eat dairy, so I left mine plain.  Bf took a taste of the filling and said ""Mm! Pretty good!"" Later on, he remarked, ""Yummy!""  Btw, I don't think 3 large peppers serves 4 people.

I did make several changes because of my dietary needs: I omitted the sugar (though I could use stevia) and vinegar, and instead used lemon juice for the vinegar.

512319,381,379750,Tasty Buds,This is by far the best sweet potato pie I have ever had. I did add some dried orange peel in addition to the orange zest which boosted the flavor. I also substituted canola oil for the butter since DH is trying to watch his fat intake. DH does not like things syrupy sweet. This pie had the perfect balance of sweetness spice and everything nice. Thank you for submitting this wonderful pie.,11/08/2007 23:25:18,11/08/2007 23:25:18

I mashed it in with the artichoke quarters.  Used light sour cream and mayo and granulated garlic.  Also reduced the Parm. to 1 1/2 cups.  I was bummed bcz I had to go to work right after I took it out of the oven!  It didn't say what to bake it in or whether to cover it or not, so I put it in a corningware dish, uncovered.

My only problem (and it's probably my technique as I'm new to this) was that it wasn't firm enough to hold it's shape when cut.

529339,1967,280840,Judielise,"This was really very good! I was skeptical because of the sour cream, but since I didn't have heavy cream in the house, I tried this. It came together and tasted great! I like the twang of the sour cream, and I added 1 cup of parmesan cheese (the bottled kind). With real parmesan cheese, I can see this having a deeper taste, but bottled was all I had on hand. I love that this has less butter, so the end result was creamy w/o the added oil. But because of maybe that lack of extra oil, I had to thin the sauce a little bit (I like my alfredo sauce a little thinner than most). I used soy creamer (yes!), but you could have used half and half or milk. I added extra cracked pepper instead of crushed red pepper flakes and threw in a 1/4 tsp of finely chopped onion because I had to use it up. Very tasty! I had shrimp, bacon and peas over capellini with this sauce and it was just right! My oldest son loved it, my sister took home the leftovers!

A friend dropped off a box (maybe 100 small squash)and I chose a bunch of Zaar yellow squash recipes that appealed to me.  The only problem is that I still have half a box left!  I already made three different recipes which I plan to rate, but there is a limit to how much one can eat......In putting the recipe together, I used a Vita Mix machine to mash the squash and mix all the ingredients.

Perhaps white sugar in the ingredients could do the trick? And when baking- they wouldn't go downward as shown in the picture- and did what was said, slightly crisscrossed.. Weird. Not sure why mine didn't turn out the same. I used margarine instead- taste was about 3 as I'm rating, but needs improvement... 3 rating~!",12/13/2007 05:25:25,12/13/2007 05:25:25

What a delight to find your recipe on this very day! I add parsnips rather than carrots and add an entire can of Guinness as well as one small tin of beef broth. My original recipe called for fresh thyme and no rosemary. I add three stocks of thyme while it cooks and then add picked thyme leaves at the very end as well as the parsley.

The cake was dry and overcooked.  I didn't have a ring pan so I used a square one.  That is my fault, not hers.  It tasted like it'd be good but it's hard to tell with an over baked, dry bread.

537734,1209,399474,Proud Veterans wife,"I think I'm the odd one out. I was disappointed after all of the rave reviews. I followed the recipe exactly and I felt it was really overpowering with the 2 cups of parmesan cheese. I ended up adding some medium cheddar cheese to try and help. It tasted okay. Some people at the party liked it. I ended up having quite a bit left over. After it was heated up it became really cheesy which is nice. I would NOT recommend anyone bringing this to a party because it cools and does not spread well when cooled. It tastes much better when it's hot. I think it would be best to serve it right out of the oven. DH did not care for it, so it was wasted. I thank you for the recipe but this just did not do it for our family.

I made French Onion soup years ago a different way and it wasn't nearly as good as this.  I didn't add the caramel color or the kitchen bouquet, it seems to be darkish without it.  

I also halved the recipe for 8 people, but I think that if you're serving 8 you should just make the entire recipe.  It made about 4 qts of soup but if I put it in my crocks w/the french bread/cheese, they may look a little bit low.

543810,607,416848,Bethie2,"This soup is outstanding! I was tempted into making it after ordering a terrible FOS in a Cheltenham restaurant last night. 

I had to cut the receipe down quite a bit - used 2 very large onions, reduced amount of butter and seasoning and then one part beef stock, one part dry wine and one part Joubere beef gravy instead of the flour.  Probably sounds like a hatchet job, but it has turned out to be absolutely delicious!  Did not have to use the caramel colouring or the kitchen bouquet.  I'll be serving it tomorrow for lunch, with the bread and gruyere, and I can't wait.

IMHO, what makes this recipe is taking the time to slow cook the onions and adding a good, dry wine like Sancerre.  Thanks Brother William!!",12/29/2007 16:17:12,12/29/2007 16:17:12

Here are a couple hints to make your Yorkshire Pudding-making experience even more successful:

The 1:1:1 ratio of ingredients makes this an easy recipe to double or triple, etc.  Measure the eggs first and make the other ingredients match.

For a smoother batter, mix it up and leave it on the counter at least a half hour before putting it in the oven.  Give it one final whisk before placing the batter into the tins and into the oven.",12/30/2007 18:50:53,12/30/2007 18:50:53

553188,468,476077,Dad the cook,"This was very good and super easy. I cant say enough about how easy this was. (Total cooking time maybe 15 minutes with salad already prepped.) I marinated 2 pieces of salmon for about 8 hours. One piece was larger and thicker than the other. My wife who is not a salmon lover (trying to convince her :), said the small piece was excellent but the larger piece still seemed fishy to her. It was fine for me and my 9 year old son! So like other posters I would agree with a longer marinade time being better. Or maybe next time I will use a vacuume canister for marinade! That said I was using store bought frozen packaged salmon not fresh caught. (sigh) I did use the sesame seeds and they are a perfect compliment to the soy sauce in the recipe. They add a nuttiness that goes perfect with the saltiness of the soy sauce. I had baked potato's left over from the night before, but did'nt want to serve baked potato's again. So I sliced them about 1/4 to 5/8's thick, and in a medium hot skillet with about 3-4 Tbl spoons olive oil I lightly fried the rounds about 4-5 mins then flipped. They were perfectly golden. Just before the second side was done I added a little shredded cheddar to each one (not smothered just a little) and covered them so the cheese would melt. I plated them, put a dot of sour cream in the center of each and garnished with fresh chives. They were crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. They went over huge! OMG perfect dish salmon, potato's and salad! My son wanted to know why we were eating so fancy lol!",01/09/2008 22:40:33,01/09/2008 22:40:33

553894,471,65768,Rodney B.,"We stuck quite close to the recipe, and the 2 of us gave it mixed reviews.  I thought the flavors were marvelous, and would easily award 4 stars.  The blend of tarragon, thyme and rosemary in the breading is sublime; it's the first time I've ever liked anything with tarragon, possibly because we used fresh not dried.  We substituted about half the oil in the vinaigrette with white wine instead, and I thought it tasted a bit like commercial salad dressing; no idea if that's due to the substitution.  I thought it might have been brighter if it used fresh-squeezed lemon juice instead of rice wine vinegar.  The horseradish in the breading practically disappears, but that's a hazard of cooking horseradish; it's always strongest uncooked.  Our big change was that we left our 1.3 lb salmon fillet whole w/ skin on the back, seared both sides, but only breaded the skinless side.  We baked 20 min, and it was still cold raw in the middle.  So then we cut into smaller fillets and broiled about 7 minutes and it was finally done just right.  My SO didn't like the breading... there was a lot of it, and we caked it on heavy since it was only on one side.  She said she might prefer a lighter breading, something Japanese-style, or only use 1c. bread crumbs.  She'd only give this 2 or grudgingly 3 stars.  Probably a recipe we'll experiment with... the herbs were wonderful!",01/10/2008 20:04:54,01/10/2008 20:04:54

I doubled the recipe for the sauce and used 1/2 cup red wine & 1/2 cup of water. Unfortunately, my family didn't care for it. The wine was over-powering and my step-son thought it was too sweet. Even so, it was fun to eat while we watched the Grammys. Thanks, again!",02/11/2008 14:37:31,02/11/2008 14:37:31

It was overly creamy, and pretty salty. I think the salty taste came from the artichoke hearts. I prefer a spinach artichoke dip that is packed full of spinach. This is more of a creamier version. I also thought the cheese flavors were a bit too overwhelming.

607419,346,762195,Yrhaven aka Condime,"I'm sure mine didn't turn out the way intended, as I cut the potatoes into smaller pieces (since I don't like large bites of potato). Then, on top of doing that, I left them in the water after boiling, until I was ready for them, (I knew all along what the result might be, based on the things I was doing lol). I considered posting my result on here as a new recipe, but realized that really, it's still the same recipe, with a slight variation, so others can choose which way they're in the mood for, each time they make it. What happened was that as I was mixing everything together, yes, go figure, the potatoes started falling apart. So, I ended up with something between mashed potatoes & potato salad, only far more garlicky, but very good. Oh, & I did add a tad of dried dill, sweet basil & white pepper. My son had wanted hamburgers, but I didn't want to serve the typical chips, or fries or macaroni & cheese with them, so when I found this recipe I thought it would be a nice fit, a little less plain. I also served it with my Caribbean Coleslaw recipe (#290325) which was nice & light which helped balance out the garlic flavor. For desert I served my Rocky Road Chocolate Mousse (#286486) which was nice, because it was cool & light, & we could each choose how much we wanted, I only had a little because by that time I was very full (duh).

Instead of a whole chicken, I used three large chunks of breast meat, cubed.  Perhaps because of this, I found one large onion to be sufficient.  The onion/flour mixture seemed to soak up the 1 oz of butter, so I ended up adding another 5 Tbls...perhaps I added too much since I wasn't sure it was really 'paste'.  I'll try adding less next time. Instead of stock from the chicken, I used four cups of bullion.  Also, I added some broccoli with the chicken.

Anyway, mashed potatoes with meat & gravy. I wanted to fix something different. I remembered the TV dinner. So to Zaar, I did turn & found this recipe. I didn't have time to use a crock pot or use dried beans. I used 2 cans of pinto beans. I rinsed them. I did not add 2 chopped onions. I sprinkled in some dried onions flakes. (I did not measure how much I added. I don't like a lot of onion.) I did not add mustard because I was out of it. I used Bulleye's Smokin' Chiptole BBQ sauce. I read the reviews, so I sprinkled in crushed red pepper. Once again, I did not measure because I like it hot. I cooked it on the stovetop. It turned out wonderful.

I make a few small (but worthwhile) changes, first, I sautee chicken breasts in a little oil and butter, then shred or cube the meat, add the BBQ sauce, and let it simmer to absorb the flavor. Then I use Green Giant Mexicorn (with red pepper) to save time. I do not put the cheese or lettuce in the black bean/onion/tomato mixture, it just gets soggy, for each salad, I put down a layer of lettuce, then the corn/bean relish, then chicken, then dressing, and top it off with the cheese and olives. Lastly, I ALWAYS serve it in a flour tortilla shell bowl! Just place a burrito sized flour tortilla in a metal (or other oven proof) bowl of appropriate size, (prick it a few times to prevent bubbles) Or use a tortilla shell bowl form which is what I have. And bake @ 350 until brown, and crisp. (about 12 min or so)  The flavor of this salad is INCREDIBLE! I just love it!

I've been wolfing them down and it feels good for me :) I just used 1 whole egg (instead of 2 whites), accidentally increased the buttermilk to 1.5 cups (defrosted from previously frozen cubes - great way to store leftover buttermilk!), and stuck to 1/2 cup honey. I was really thinking about adding 1/4 cup brown sugar because some reviews said they're not sweet enough, but I thought it was perfect  - a hint of honey but not too sweet. My husband would want more sweetness though. I used 1+1/4 cup of frozen wild blueberries, and that was more than enough.

I am not a fan of the real stuff and it is almost never on hand ... most often use yogurt with spice as a sub. but this definitely works better with salad-type & sammie recipes because of the moisture factor (things won't get  that icky soggy way with this) ~~cool~~ nice flavor & texture...used 2 tbl. spoons of lemon juice and only 1 tbl. spoon of oil (was eyeballing texture for a particular recipe ) -no cider vinegar on hand, BUT I always have this incredible tofu  :) - bought by the block (ala help yourself to what you want) at my local Health Food store where I get it for an excellent $$ so this recipe is cost efficient for me to do and I will be from now on...I am going to be trying different 'mustard type' flavorings (wasabi, chipotle, hot ""Colemans"" ...etc...)   cool recipe to have in '""mental ~~notebook'""    :)

She then added a bit more flour to the second batch and though they didn't break into pieces when coming off the pan they are still so thin around the edges (much like a lace cookie) that they will not hold up well for a bake sale. She is keeping her fingers crossed that the giant cookie she baked in a small disposable foil casserole pan turned out so that she can sell it by the slice.",06/20/2008 09:35:52,06/20/2008 09:35:52
656745,70,868335,Campbellssoupkid,I believe there is a serious error in this recipe. Perhaps it should call for 2 Tbsp water instead of 2 cups? I had to add at least another 1 1/2 cups flour to get it to a kneadable stage. Not sure if it will turn out!,06/21/2008 17:55:53,06/21/2008 17:55:53

657146,76,851190,carolynryanlv,I used this sauce to have with some fettucine.  It was so good!  I cooked it slow and let the flavors blend together and give the sauce a chance to thicken.  I added some steamed spinach and mushrooms at the end of cooking time and let the spinach sit just long enough to heat up.  It was wonderful.  Make sure you don't get the heat too high.  I think that may have something to do with it getting gritty.  Try cooking it slow and see if you have better results like I did.  Thanks for sharing Marg!,06/23/2008 01:32:52,06/23/2008 01:32:52

To one of these (my dads) I added 1/4 cup of Four Roses Small Batch Bourbon (he works at the distillery, I add bourbon to almost everything!) and also made a few cups of bourbon whipped cream to serve over it. It was GREAT with and without the bourbon!
Note: If you decide to add the bourbon start with a couple of tablespoons and then add to taste from there. If you go the entire 1/4 cup cut the buttermilk back by a couple of tablespoons.",06/23/2008 16:02:30,06/23/2008 16:02:30

I served it with baguette chips seasoned with garlic, parsley and olive oil cooking spray that I made myself and I think it was a perfect combo.  The only changes I made to the dip were to add pepper to the mix because i thought it needed some spicing up, and I put a little freshly shredded Romano cheese on top.  Next time I make it (and there will definitely be many more next times) I will cook it in a more shallow dish, as the brown crusty parts on top were the best!

You know, the kind you cut in two pieces and stick in the toaster, then smother with butter and peanut butter or your favorite jelly or jam and savor every mouthful?  These are IT!  Love them!!!  I used a glass (PLASTIC one) or you can use a round biscuit or cookie cutter as well.  Anything round works, even a glass glass, which I have used for years and NEVER had one break.  Must have been a flaw in the glass Hilda used.  Housewives and bakes alike have been using glasses to do biscuits and muffins for the last 100 years.  If it scares you then use plastic.  Works just as well.  The muffins came out so good  and flavorful, and I loved the recipe, so I will use it again instead of buying  Thomas' English Muffins again.

In checking a few recipe sites, I see that most similar recipes call for a variety of other spices (like ginger and a few others).   I also thought the pineapple flavor was refreshing, but the lemon didn't really add much to the overall taste.

I don't like muffins sweet and routinely cut back the sugar 25%, so if these weren't sweet enough for me (even with 3 tablespoons of raw sugar sprinkled on top), most people will want more sugar in these. I followed a lot of other reviewers and used brown sugar instead of honey, one egg, 1/2 tsp salt, and added 1 tsp almond extract. For the reviewer whose blueberries sank, you can toss them with a tablespoon of the dry mixture and stir them at the end to prevent this. Mine were done baking at 19 minutes, but I was prepared for this, since a lot of people mentioned that (and I have never baked muffins longer than say 23 minutes).

I used fat free, evaporated milk, instead of whipping cream (as another reviewer suggested), as the soup was still creamy, hearty and delicious.  I had no parsley, so I omitted it.  I used Old Bay seasoning, lemon pepper, and salt to season, but felt something was missing so I added a good tablespoon or two, of Emerils original seasoning.  That did the trick.  If you don't have Emeril's, I think a good spice mix of garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, paprika and extra salt will give it an extra kick that puts it over the top.  I served it hot with some extra shredded cheddar over the top.  I will definitely be making this to impress at my next dinner party!",08/05/2008 03:24:35,08/05/2008 03:24:35

I had some pre-cooked chicken and canned stewed tomatoes. 

I sauteed the squash, garlic, and threw the rosemary in too, then added the tomatos, lime zest and lime juice and cubed cooked chicken, covered and put in oven for 20 minutes. Thickened the sauce with a little flour. 

Just zest a lime with a zester- don't fuss with the matchstick cuts - we did the matchsticks and I believe a zester would be better.

I had to cook mine for quite a bit longer as the insides were still very raw.  I do like medium rare.  So, I stopped at medium rare.  It did have great flavor.  But, the sauce just looked gross and was all separted. The pictures posted were so beautiful!  I'm going to have another go at this but take someone's advice to add flour and milk to make more of cream sauce instead of such a greasy sauce.  I did cook the patties a bit to pour off the meat grease before I began with the sauce.  Thanks for a great start!",09/30/2008 01:42:39,09/30/2008 01:42:39

She is a gardener, not a cook :)
I did these up for her, and wrapped in alfoil and froze them.
She defrosted the packets for a day in the fridge, and baked for 30 mins.
She said they didnt look great, but they tasted wonderfull!

First melted in a large glass bowl added the flour stirred till smooth, added the milk and microwaved till thick. Mixed the eggs and ricotta together till smooth and then added to the sauce. I would next time use 1 cup less milk. I had a lot left over that would have overfilled the pan.  Didn`t have parm so I use mozzarella cheese. I do think the parm would be the better choice.

I doubled the recipe and used half ground sirloin and half ground turkey.

I misread the recipe the first time and put the extra tomato sauce on top of the peppers PRIOR to baking for 25 mins instead of waiting until the end and didn't think it made any difference.  I had a little trouble fitting the peppers into the square pans suggested and wound up cooking a double batch with 4 pepper halves in the square pan and  the other 8 in a 13x9.

I used my blender since I don't have a food processor.I can't believe how quick it is to make. I grew up with my Aunt's homemade butter that was not very good LOL
This was really nice but next time I will add just a bit of salt.It is sweeter then a store bought butter.
I used a piece of cheescloth in my sieve so I could gently use it to ""squeeze "" the liquid out.

755614,632,1029303,Holly24tm,"This is a phenominal blueberry muffin recipe!  My parents try to eat healthy but still like to have sweet treats.  They raved about these muffins.  I made some slight changes.  I added a small amount of brown sugar because I ran out of honey.  I also topped the muffins with a pinch of brown sugar, as was suggested.  It is important to toss the frozen (this tip may work for fresh as well) blueberries in 2TBS. of flour and let them rest for a few minutes before incorporating.  That way the blueberries will not run and turn the batter purple.  This recipe made more than 12 muffins.  My parents keep requesting that I make these again.  I will try different ingredients such as raisins and walnuts next time.  Thank you so much for the great recipe!

You don't notice the salty taste if you make a sausage biscuits or dip them in gravy, but if you eat them with jam (or anything sweet) you really notice the overabundance of salt.",11/29/2008 00:29:14,11/29/2008 00:29:14

757654,1716,88272,aloha808,"5 Stars for taste and texture on the one pan of (12 cavity) mini bundt cake muffins but the 8x4 Loaf Pan took 1-1/2 hours to bake through (it just came out of the oven) with the last 20 minutes, the oven temperature up to 325. It's very dark and crusty on the outside but I expect the inside will be okay. I've made many Quick Bread recipes and while it isn't noted in this recipe, my batter was very lumpy and it was difficult to tell if the flour was completely distributed. I didn't want to overmix, so finally just stopped, leaving it pretty lumpy (before the coconut and nuts were added). The only change I made was to use Pecans instead of Walnuts, as that is all I had. The taste is great, so I'm sure there will be a next time -- I may add orange zest and drizzle with a chocolate glaze too.

I baked at 325 for approx. 10-12 minutes, until quite browned on edges. They stay sort of soft until completely cool, when they become crispy. Next time I would like to shorten the baking time so they're not so brown- I believe they would still be crispy.

770266,54,621060,Laya Sriraam,"Im a 23 year old doctor from india. Im a novice baker ( this being my third cake ever) .I chose this recipe from about a dozen carrot cake recipes , because of its ease and also because husbands are critical judges , and this one passed ! 
I made a lot of mistakes during the process.
For one , i halved the recipe, and then i used a bundt whose size i didnt know, as a result of which i didnt know how long to bake it , but baked it for 40 mins anyway !
my cake ended up looking slightly brown throughout as opposed to orange-ish...obvious signs that it is overbaked :(

i am yet to taste it because i want my husband to come home and see it before we can dig in !

i will post on how it turned out ..

however , i learnt a lot of important baking lessons from this cake .. and i really want to thank you for that , marg

I cut the artichoke hearts up but other than that I fixed it exactly as written. FANTASTIC! *UPDATE* I continue to serve this dip every Christmas. We all adore it. This year, to make it more in keeping with WW, I used low-fat versions of the Parmesan cheese, sour cream, cream cheese and mayo. It was still as fabulous!

776767,280,978369,Amy Zupkow,"This is one of my favorite foods.  Kenk's is a very traditional recipe and not unlike mine.  However, I do a few things differently.  I have found that coarsely grating my potatoes helps make the tortillas more stable during and after cooking.  I start my onions cooking while I'm grating the potatoes and I cook them in about 3T of olive oil.  I use almost as much onion as potato but I don't add garlic because it damages the delicate flavor of the tortilla and isn't as good cold.  The egg to potato ratio is very important.  Basically the egg mixture should easily cover the potatoes when you mix them together.  After you stir the potatoes into the eggs be sure to let them sit for 5 minutes before you pour them into the hot pan to form tortillas.  I use an 8"" omlet pan and usually cook two tortillas.  This pan makes the sliding / flipping process much easier and lets you peek under the edge for doneness.  I actually don't flip my tortillas.  I kept trying but had some incredibly horrible failures.  My method is to slide the tortilla onto a large plate and then invert the pan over it and flip the plate and pan quickly.  During the cooking process (before the slide) I take the pan off the heat and let it rest for a few minutes several time.  This helps the runny center set up.  Just be sure that it is hot and sliding around in the pan before you attempt the slide or flip.  You also want to be careful not to overcook because the finished tortilla is best with a creamy texture.  I frequently stray from the traditional by adding a small amount of grated cheddar to the mix (gives a beautiful golden quality to the crust) and sprinkling some on the finished tortilla.  I used to add red and yellow peppers but it too can overpower the simple but delicious flavor of the tortilla.  My husband cares less about tradition and likes crumbled bacon added to the mix.  I usually give in.  Last thing...practice makes perfect when it comes to tortillas so if your first few tries are less than stellar, don't give up!",12/30/2008 23:40:57,12/30/2008 23:40:57

I live in Seattle and for the last 15 years have eaten at a very popular restaurant who serves this very recipe.  It is very popular here, they make it fresh daily, sells for $5.00 a slice and it sells out all the time.  I have wanted the recipe for years, even asked the owner one day and she wouldnâ€™t give out her secret. I have searched apple crisp recipes for a long time and finally, today I have been successful.  I was so excited when I first tasted it and realized I found the right recipe that I was laughing and clapping in the kitchen.  Delicious, my favorite with fresh whip crÃ¨me, perfectly balanced, not over sweet.

I made a single cup and used fat free creamer for the half and half. The chocolate shines and the coffee gives an outstanding performance in a supporting role and that are an ideal team.

This was the first time I've made spaetzle, but it won't be the last! It takes a lot of time to get them into the little bits of dough to cook. So I improvised and ended up using a colander held over a large pot of boiling water and pouring some batter in, and then used a spoon to press down on the batter, pushing it through the holes in the colander. That was slow, so I tried using the bottom of a mixing bowl to press the batter through the colander, into the boiling water below, and it worked! It's messy to do it, and takes two people (one to hold the colander over the pot of water, but it's worth the mess and effort! And you get a lot of spaetzle out at once. After cooking, I fried them in some butter, and added some salt. These were so amazing, I'm going to buy a spaetzle press to use the next time I make them.

Don't laugh but I forgot to put the tomatoe paste miture with the meat and cook- I actually put the 8 ingredients in the microwave to hurry it along as I was cooking the meat and onions and before I knew it I was layering as directed , put in the oven. Let's just say I topped it with the tomatoe mixture and cooked as usual. 
I sauteed my zucchini ( in Olive Oil) and I used more then stated but no need to drain. I also used crushed red pepper instead of black pepper. I didn't have an excess of liquid at all- never a need to cook the tomatoe paste mix either. A very forgiving recipe and absolutely wonderful.

Anyway, I omitted the crust entirely and greased a glass pie pan. Baked as directed, first for 10 mins at 400, then 50 mins at 350 and ended up with a really thin and light and creamy custard with a caramelly top.

Its a very easy & versatile recipe that gives great flavour to plain old boring brown rice. Due to lack of ingredients, I made the following substitutions: dried thyme for savory, powdered ginger for fresh, purple onion for green & lemon pepper for zest. I added dethawed frozen pea pods & broccoli florets once the celery & onions were tender. I'll repeat this recipe with different veggie combinations in the future.

It wasn't really sweet (enough for most of us) or very chocolate-y so I did try and rescue it by adding small amounts of additional sugar and cocoa alternately but with no  real success. I tried to finish the mix at work just not to waste it but in the end, liked it so little that I threw the rest of the mix out... something I try to do as a very very last resort with any recipe. Clearly it worked wonderfully for all the other reviewers and I am dissapointed that it didn't work for me too, but all my ingredients were fresh and local and I can't find any logical  reason at all why it didn't  work for us.

I was originally not going to make the sauce and make my own instead, but I got lazy and decided to give it a try. I was amazed! I omitted the sugar because of what others had said and since I really don't like overly sweet pizza sauce, used white wine (probably close to double the recommended amount) and added some chopped fresh italian parsley and crushed red pepper flakes.

821033,749,164493,discriminating tast,"This is one of those recipes where you really make it your own. I doubt I would have liked it so much if I followed the recipe to a T- especially the cottage cheese part (not a fan!). I took some tips from other chefs and made some modifications. Used fresh basil, fresh thyme, low fat ricotta & mozzarella, ground sirloin, and grilled eggplant as the ""noodle."" I also doubled on the garlic and used some to saute along with the onions & beef. I hardly cook meat without seasoning so I seasoned the meat with Adobo & black pepper before cooking it. I think it's important to season to your tastes. Since the beefy sauce is what really makes the meal, taste as you go along before baking it. I added ground cayenne and some more dry Italian seasoning to get the beefy sauce to the right spice for my tastes. I like how the recipe called for fresh tomatoes because using canned might have been too salty. It just had a fresher taste that way. I even topped with red pepper flakes when it was done (I like spice!). Next time I make it, I'll try it with zucchini. Oh I almost forgot! Definitely use the full 1lb of beef for the 4 servings.

830889,1551,565650,Chef 565650 Jim,"This is a good basic recipe that permits you to â€œgo where your taste buds send you.â€�  I started with a pound of ground round that was very lean. I then medium ground about 8 ounces of fatty pork/bacon for flavor and moisture. I added this to the skillet where I had already browned a medium onion and 3 or 4 cloves of garlic. I added the ground beef and ground pork to the pan and browned everything together. Drain off fat when cooked. To the skillet, I seasoned with salt, ground black pepper, a sprig of marjoram, lemon thyme, and a few sprigs of fresh parsley and cilantro finely chopped. I chopped Â½ a large red sweet pepper for color and flavor. Decided I wanted some mild heat so I added about Â¼ tsp. of red pepper flakes. To this whole mixture I added almost a pint of mild salsa (very mild home- made salsa) and about 1/3 cup of tomato paste. Save about1/3 cup of a combination of the salsa and tomato puree in a separate dish and add a squirt of Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce to your taste.  Tasting the skillet mixture, I added about 1 Tbsp. of steak sauce. Make sure you wash your peppers and drop in boiling water for from 3 to 5 minutes. Remove and let cool enough to handle. Lay pepper on its side and cut in half. Opting for a chewy and healthy grain mixture, I had previously cooked Â¼ cup of pearl barley and Â¾ cup of brown rice (did not use it all). The rice takes 40 minutes and the barley 45 so they cook well together. I cleaned the peppers of membranes and seeds as well as possible and started filling the peppers with a 60 percent meat mixture and 40 percent rice mixture (guess on this). Take 3 pieces of Fontina cheese (about 1 inch by Â½ inch) and insert into the pepper filling while stuffing with the rice and meat mixture. Mound the rice-meat mixture high on the peppers with the inside of a large cooking spoon. Donâ€™t worry, it will stay together. Place in backing dish and drizzle a little leftover salsa â€“ tomato puree (remember you saved it from above) into the bottom of the dish with about 1/8 inch of water. Cover with foil and cook for 20 minutes at 325 or 350. Remove foil and cover top of pepper with grated cheese (I used sharp cheddar as that was what I had) and place one spoonful of the salsa â€“ tomato puree on top of that. Cook an additional 5 minutes. Plate and make a pattern on the plate with just a tiny bit of the remaining salsa â€“ tomato puree. Serve and enjoy. 
Now my point to all of this is that this is not a â€œset in stoneâ€� recipe. Make it to suit what you have available and what your tongue dictates. Try to go a little â€œoutside the boxâ€� once in awhile to try some new tastes. Jim McNulty in California on 3-17-09",03/20/2009 13:23:31,03/20/2009 13:23:31
831157,607,260325,Salmon of Doubt,"Next time, I plan on making this in the crock pot or leave the house for a few hours so it can simmer in peace. Since I started making this, I have been munching on it and it's a wonder there's any left. The longer you can stand to let it simmer (it smells delicious while cooking) the more the flavours come out. I halved the recipe as I'm the only one in a two-person household who eats onions -- plus, I had just about 2.5 lbs, exactly, to use up. Another recipe I saw called for brown sugar to carmelize the onions. I gave that a shot and added about 3/4 tsp. of dark brown sugar. I didn't notice a difference in the taste. I used 4 bullion cubes in about 3.5 cups of water. When I was making the flour thickening, I added more flour than I intended and thinned it out with more broth until I got it to a consistency I liked. I didn't bother with the caramel colouring as I didn't have it on hand or thought the soup needed it. I did have to substitute provolone cheese for the gruyere, but the soup is fantastic without it too. Thanks for sharing a lip-smackingly delicious recipe.

Between 2 thin slices of lightly toasted cake (cooled) I spread  cheese-colored whipped topping.  When hubby came in I announced it would be a light supper and nodded to the cold skillet the ""sandwich"" rested in.  

 I made a shepherd's pie to go with, coloring the potatoes pink.  It looked like strawberry cake. Next to it sat the strawberries (for the pound cake later) adding to the illusion.  

Finally I pulled off an April Fool's Joke.  Thanks for such a great recipe.  

I did have to made a couple of subs out of necessity.  One was usuing imitation butter extract in place of the lemon.  The other was using diet ginger ale instead of 7-up.    I was shocked when the mixture fizzed up but all turned out perfect.  I am so thankful you posted.",04/02/2009 15:53:23,04/02/2009 15:53:23

I didn't know what to expect but I picked about 6 valencia oranges & 2 meyer lemons from my garden & went to town.  I didn't have the peppers on hand so I used 1 teaspoon each of ground chile arbol & ground new mexico medium heat chili.  It was still missing a little something so I tossed in about 3 tablespoons of chicken base as the sauce reduced.  Cooked for about an hour at 350, spooning a little of the sauce over the roast every 15 minutes & was very pleasantly surprised!  This was even better than Claim Jumper folks.  What little was left was saved for later, I was going to give the doggies a little treat as there wasn't much but my honeybunny barred the door and said he wanted to take it to work tomorrow.

When I came home w/ haddock he went right to the computer, logged on to my account on 'zaar and searched for haddock recipes.  (I'm so proud of him :-)).  This is the recipe he decided on and was it ever yummy!  There were only 3 of us eating tonight so I only purchased 1 fillet which was 1 Â¼ pounds.  My DH adusted the recipe for 3 servingsâ€¦ so perhaps we had more topping than the recipe intended but we thought it was a perfect amount.  He used a liberal shake of red pepper flakes in lieu of cayenne pepper.   The recipe did not mention anything about the skin.....my DH placed the haddock skin-side down in the baking dish, and hoped the fish would seperate from the skin like it does when grilling.  However the skin came along with the fillet so we just took our bites from the top, scraping them off the skin.  I think I'll ask the fish guy to remove the skin for me next time I buy haddock.   My 12 year old DS thought the fish was too spicy, not â€˜spicy hotâ€™ but just too spicy.  We scraped the topping off but he still just pickedâ€¦.his loss!  DH served with basmati rice and a salad.

When I sauteed the chicken initially, I coated it in some montreal chicken seasoning to add another layer of flavor and I'm glad I did or I think it would have been missing something.

886611,1356,574377,TheDucksnest,"Cindy was right, these need a little more flavor.  For a Southwestern touch, you can add a McCormick Chili mix (Hot or Mild) to the meat during mixing.  But just to make them taste better, use Tony Chashere's Cajun Seasoning to the mixture before stuffing.  Careful, use it instead of salt, and a little goes a long way, but it really is great.  Or you can use Emeril's Cajun seasoning.",06/10/2009 14:17:42,06/10/2009 14:17:42

886995,1356,1178797,cooking_neko83,"Made this dish last night for me and my husband. Neither of us had stuffed peppers before, so this was a treat! Made a few changes: used ground turkey instead of beef, did not pre-cook the peppers (we like a bit of crunch left!), and added rosemary, garlic powder, and Chipotle Tabasco. I followed the recommendation to add more water, but I added a bit too much. I was able to remedy that by using a slotted spoon to drain the meat mix while filling up the peppers. It's great topped with cheese, sour cream, and some diced green chilies on the side. Will definitely make again!!

One night, it occurred to me...find it on the internet.  Over the years, I've tried other French Onion Soups at various cafes and restaurants.  What I found was that there is NO comparison.  This is, by far, the BEST THERE IS.  The rich, thick consistency allows the baguette to float beautifully atop the soup.

Will add 1/2 cup more rhubarb next time for higher fruit to crunch ratio.  Crumb mix is soooooo good - though should be able to cut brown sugar by 1/8 cup without sacrificing taste.  Can't wait to try it with other fillings.  Used 1 tsp honey in place of 1/2 cup sugar in syrup, since a recent review stated it ""Was plenty sweet enough without the added sugar.""  My new garden's rhubarb apparently needs some sweetening, sadly.  Topped with 1/2 cup chopped almonds, sweetened flake cereal, and granola for last 10 minutes of baking to toast, adding more crunch and nutrition.  Will add nuts to bottom layer as well next time.  Overall a delightful treat.  Heading back to the kitchen for some more nibbling, and I'm not even a nibbler.",07/03/2009 03:15:02,07/03/2009 03:15:02

It looks like a down home cake, not an upscale restuarant cake.  My family loves down home cakes. However, there is a few problems with the recipe itself In step 3 it says to add the oil, but the list of ingredients does not have oil .  I added 1/2 cup and it worked out fine.  and in your instructions you never mentioned the applesauce. I added this with the rest of my ingredients.
Love the texture, lots of different things going on with the walnuts carrots raisins and coconut.  I had never thought of using five spice like this and the flavor turned out great.

When I looked in on them when time was up the sauce looked really gross looking with like clumps of discolored stuff, but I though I could fix that if the taste of the meatballs were good. But I tried one and said no....the aftertaste was not good, not sure if it had to do with lemon or what.

For me though, this was a good thing.  I often forgo any sort of sweet topping on similar desserts because the sweetness is too much for me.  This particular crumble's tartness is a great pairing for ice, whip & sweetened creams, much to my delight!

This is terrific! I am up alot at night so keeping up with Zaar is one of the things I do.  Came across this recipe last night and had to make it immediately as I had all the ingredients on hand.  Used SMart Balance for margarine and WheyLow brown sugar--otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Well, I guess not.  I put it in a ceramic rectangular pan sprayed with PAM rather than using  foil. Had to have a piece right away.  Came out of the pan with ease and tasted AWESOME.  The cookie part was probably the best oatmeal cookie I've had in ages.  Can already think of a number of variations. Apple raisin /cinnamon; cherry almond; pumpkin spice.  Anyway thank you for a great midnight snack.

915001,1356,1260491,Winning Wendy,"This was a good starting point recipe.  Do to my unpreparedness, I had to make some changes and created a new version of this classic.  One big change was I used ground turkey.  Those come in 19-20 oz. packages, which was good since I had eight peppers (some red and yellow too).  I took the tips from Cindy and added about four shakes of hot sauce into the meat mixture.  But I went a bit further (since my family likes it kicked up a notch). I added two tablespoons of chopped green chilies (canned) too.  I also like the idea of mushrooms I saw in another recipe.  So I chopped up about a 3/4th cup and added it to the meat mixture as well.  I had instant brown rice (not the long grain) so the simmer time was reduces to only 10-12 min.  Other than that the only other addition I made was topping it with more cheese.  Since I had more meat and eight peppers, I did increase the other ingredients a bit - but the measurments were not too specific.  The results were amazing - my friend and family are clammoring for more.  I'll add this one to my favorites.  Enjoy!",07/25/2009 15:58:19,07/25/2009 15:58:19

I also used dried dill and added some extra as posted and it turned out wonderful. This is such a great refreshing salad to have for lunch.

A word to low-carbers:  Whole Milk Ricotta cheese has less carbs than the other ones.  When I came to the final step of adding the top portion of cheese, I added a light sprinkling of Parmesan cheese on the top as well.  It browned very nicely.

I got 10 biscuits that I cut out with a cookie cutter, next time I will roll into balls and place in a pan so that when they cook and rise they will touch so we can pull them apart.

I would say to roast the eggplant just a little longer for that smokey flavor I love. I did 45 minutes and think 50 - 55 minutes may be better (of course it depends on the size of the eggplant).  Also, just a little less lemon juice and tahini.  I used 3 cloves of garlic and it was perfect.  Salt? about 1 tsp. Also, I put the olive oil directly in rather than use it as a topping.

The cocoa, should be dutch darker, with more taste to it..  We have to remember that these are HOMEMADE recipes not made in a factory, read the ingredients, on a box of hot cocoa mix, 98% of what is in it won't be in a Homemade mixture so that is why most people don't think it's sweet enough.

I am making this again this evening for my husband who has requested I throw a diced up jalepeno in!!! I'll let you know how it turns out! Thanks again!",08/28/2009 01:35:36,08/28/2009 01:35:36

My family ate it in less than 12 hours, we couldn't even wait for it to cool.  It took a full hour and ten minutes for it to bake in my oven, but I was using a glass pan.  I ended up having to cover it in tin foil so that the top didn't burn before the middle baked.  It was great though.",08/28/2009 01:22:12,08/28/2009 01:22:12

I also used tomatoes from the garden and normal onion, as that's what I had, and it still tasted good. If i had been thinking I would've cut the tomatoes into wedge slices or bigger bite size pieces... because it said chopped, I cut the tomatoes into smaller pieces.  Also I imagine that goat cheese would do very well in this salad. after i cut the tomatoes I noticed lots of juice as mine were seedy, so I strained them before adding in the liquids.",08/29/2009 16:18:38,08/29/2009 16:18:38

It could have used a little more kick but still yummy. I also made 1/2 the recipe without the meat and just hot sauce...Also, yummy.

935123,280,593927,UmmBinat,"Delicious for DH, DD (toddler) & I as per my slight modifications. I used two medium small potatoes and 6 eggs but next time would use only 5. I cooked the potatoes in 1/2 inch of extra virgin olive oil (I do suggest regular olive oil like another reviewer because mine smoked too much). I did not let the potatoes brown much at all. I then added the onion in a lesser amount. I covered the pan to slightly steam the potatoes and onions in order not to brown them and to cook them faster. When they were just about cooked I added sea salt (which was not coarse) to them which I think is very important or the dish will come out to bland. I kept these for a few hours in the refridgerator until morning (suhoor) so it would be much faster to finish. This worked well. I finished the recipe as per instructions also giving a little bit of salt to the eggs. I will definitely make this again.",08/29/2009 21:10:21,08/29/2009 21:10:21

947778,153,353381,Mrs.R,"Awesome!  I made this painless starter in a 1-gallon ziploc bag.  You DO NOT need to add any yeast.  When it was time to bake the bread, I froze the two starters you are supposed to give to friends.  In place of the 1 cup of oil, I used applesauce, with no problems.  I have also substituted different flour combinations: white, whole wheat, whole wheat pastry, golden white.  Our favorite has been half golden white and half whole wheat.  I have also used sugar-free vanilla pudding and liked that just as much.  The starters that I froze taste just as good as the ""fresh"" ones. Everyone I have made this for loves it!

948941,1356,966321,amanda.dobey,"I made this last night and it was delicious! I had to double the recipe because we had a lot of peppers ready from the garden. I used ground turkey instead of beef, used tomatoes from the garden instead of canned tomatoes (just used a bit more water than the recipe called for to substitute for the missing juice), more worchestershire sauce, and more cheese, which I mixed between cheddar and mozzarella. The main reason I made these changes was so that I wouldn't have to go to the store for one or two items, and the doubling of the batch was a last minute thing. I also added extra seasoning when the mixture was simmering with the rice (an herb mixture that I use on chicken a lot). I loved them, and boyfriend said they were amazing. We only baked four of the ones we stuffed and froze the remaining ones for later use. The blanching of the peppers really cut down on the baking time, and they peppers were so tender, but not mushy. I will def make these again.",09/17/2009 20:45:47,09/17/2009 20:45:47

This recipe taste just like the Stewed Tomatoes K-Mart Family Restaurant serves. The copy of the recipe I have is slightly different it does not call for green pepper. The sugar is 1-2 Tbl. I add 1/4 cup chopped onion. When I made these tonight I used 8 small tomatoes and Splenda for the sugar. Overall this is a great recipe! Thanks for posting such a great recipe!

When you chill it for several hours it tastes one way-very Hawaiian and when you let it warm up while serving you can really taste the olives. Both ways were winners.

I'm sitting in a Nairobi guest house with minimal ingredients.  Had to leave out the cornstarch and soured some milk by adding vinegar.  Sprinkled with salt before baking.  The bread was excellent.

I used one whole egg, used brown sugar and increased it to about 3/4 cup, added 1/4 tsp. sea salt, and added about a tsp. of vanilla. I also sprinkled sugar in the raw on the tops of the muffins. I baked the muffins at 400 for about 23 minutes and they came out beautifully! They were big and puffy and tasted as good as they looked! Not to sweet and they had a nice fluffy texture. Next time I will try with only egg whites since that makes the muffins practically cholesterol free. These are a keeper! They taste great and are healthier then the average blueberry muffin.

989149,1005,1376400,myoungp,the review is for the sauce alone. It was pretty good although I made some changes. I used 2 tsp of brown sugar instead of 1 tbsp. Same goes with olive oil. I also added only a little more that 1/4 tsp salt. I tossed in a clove of garlic that I took out when the sauce was done. I sub dried parsley for oregano and that's fine. I like the rich wine flavor in the sauce but may try half wine half broth next time because it takes more time than I'm willing to spend to cook the alcohol down.,11/15/2009 06:10:57,11/15/2009 06:10:57

Then I asked someone else to make this recipe and they used frozen spinach (i'm guessing with over 300 5 star reviews that won't cause a problem!) and used the kind of parmesan cheese that you buy powdery in a tub meant for shaking onto pasta - the results were awful.

I kicked the temp down to 350 as soon as i put the pie in the oven so it wouldnt burn before set. Also placing a layer of foil over the pie can keep it from burning before the pie is set. I did add about a tablespoon of lemon zest to give it kind of a kick and it turned out really good. I plan on making several of these during the holidays for friends and family.

995332,1356,1307411,SFBornandRaised,"5 Stars for the sheer versatility.  You could really make this with any seasoning you like to give it an Italian/Cajun/Mexican/Asian/Etc. inspired taste.
I normally donâ€™t adjust recipes off the bat, I usually make them first and then the second time, adjust.  But in reading other reviews, and looking at the ingredients, I could surmise that the flavor would be lacking as there is no additional seasoning.  
My variation came out fantastic  - Husband said he had always stayed away from stuffed bell peppers as they were bland, gross and too much pepper.  Well, he loved these, ate the inside, the peppers and even went back for a second pepper!  A staple that will be added to my roster of pretty easy weekday dinners.
6 Medium Peppers (2 Orange, 2 Yellow 2 Red)  - save tops to equal about 1 cup diced
1.5 Ground Beef
1 Whole chopped Yellow Onion
1	14.5 oz can Diced Tomatoes
Â¾ Cup Basmati rice
Â¾ Cup Water
1 tsp Mediterranean Sea salt â€“ course grind to taste
1 Tablespoon Lea and Perrins Worsteshire Sauce
1Â½ Cup Shredded Kraft Sharp Cheddar (Fine Shred)
Heaping Tablespoons Minced Garlic
1 Tbsp San Francisco Seasoning (Spice Islands) â€“ About 1 tablespoon total
1 Tbsp Louisiana Style Cajun Seasoning (Spice Islands) â€“ About 1 tablespoon total
1 Tbsp Red Pepper Flakes (Spice Islands)  - About 1 tablespoon total
Â½ Cup Shredded mozzarella for tops
Followed the recipe â€“ I chop the Bell tops to equal 1 cup, I add the garlic and about half the SF/Cajun/Red Pepper flakes with the mixture.  When I get to step 10, I add all of the ingredients except the rice, stir taste and add the rest of the seasoning to taste â€“ then add the rice.  Before you add the cheese, taste again for seasoning needs.  Add Cheddar â€“ Taste again as this will pretty much taste as serve.  Adjust.
Bake for 30 minutes.  Sprinkle Â½ cup mozzarella.  Bake 5 more minutes.  Yum!",10/17/2009 19:10:36,10/17/2009 19:10:36

This 5-star recipe stood out by adding the leftover meat mixture to the baking pan.   

I used homegrown tomatoes, garlic and fresh basil, and cooked the rice separately, as I didn't trust the 1:1 ratio for rice:water. I added local cheddar at the end of baking, just because that's a familiar procedure. Now I'm about to taste the resultsâ€¦

It's wonderful, a real meal, and you don't feel like you're forced to eat a whole bell pepper; it's the shell for all this other good stuff. The pepper tastes deeper and more flavorful than almost any other way you can use it. This is excellent simple food, a gift of love to family and friends.",08/14/2008 05:09:51,08/14/2008 05:09:51

Also I did not put it in a shallow casserole, I think it might turn out better in a flatter dish.  Next time I try it I will add some more seasoning (like herbs and pepper) and maybe not squeeze out the spinach.

1007277,1406,1480997,marko90402,"AWESOME recipe.  Simple and authentic tasting.

To the other reviewer who gave the unnecessary 1-star rating - you stated the meat came out dry.  Try baking in an oven (convection if you have it) and place the meat on a cookie sheet.  Add water to the bottom of the pan below the cookie sheet (or in a separate pan if you are putting it on a baking pan) to keep moisture in the oven. 

Cooking only takes 30-45 minutes if you slice it thin enough.  

AWESOME recipe!  Thanks for sharing.",12/13/2009 06:54:37,12/13/2009 06:54:37

One thing to remember is to generously coat the dough ball in powdered sugar.  Cover it well enough that you can't see any dough through it.  Pack it on.  Then when you put in on the sheet, flatten slightly with the palm of your hand.  This makes for prettier cookies.  I've never greased the sheets, since they are so covered in powdered sugar.

1010751,168,1482967,Acceptance,"Tasty...BUT...what I got was a very dry and crumbly mixture that would not hold together at all. I added a bit more water and golden syrup but i was not thrilled with the consistency of the dough and had to press it together to make my tablespoons not be all crumbs. I baked as directed and I got a tasty biscuit/cookie but not what I expected. I showed them to a friend in AU who said it was wrong and pulled up several recipes for me...all similar but they mostly used a full cup brown sugar, a full cup coconut, 2 T of golden syrup and 1t of baking soda. The dough moister and the brown sugar allowed for a better spreading of the cookie - the first did not spread at all.

The golden syrup I was prepared to have to substitute for and instead found it rather easily here in Florida! However the unsweetened coconut was the challenge to my surprise and finally found it in a health food shop. They didn't know what dessicated was but that is exactly what they were selling.
**OK, must be me so I upped the stars. With changes based on other similar recipes still very crumbly and not what I expected..so must just be me. Like I said..tasty no matter what!",12/19/2009 16:35:21,12/19/2009 16:35:21

I used canned chicken breasts because I was trying to test to see if this would be easy enough to make while camping. I still cooked it in the pan with garlic it just didnt cook as long. I doubled the garlic.. we are garlic fans round here. I used green enchilada sauce in lieu od picante sauce.  I like it better.  I also mixed in a few tablespoons of sour creme in with the 1/2 cup enchilada sauce to make it more like chicken sour cream enchiladas.  I also, based off another enchilada recipe I had my eye on spread the bottom of my baking sheet with a small layer of sour cream before placing the enchiladas in the pan.  Next time I make this I am omitting the red bell peppers... I ended up picking them out and my husbands wasnt a fan of them either...

I also had put in about 2 Tbs. of Worchestire sauce instead of Kitchen Bouquet and did not put any salt in it.  I did use the wine but I think I would like to try sherry the next time. I find it adds a little different taste. The house smells so good when this is simmering. I chose to go with gruyere cheese. Personally I find this is the perfect cheese for this soup.

1047745,310,1541360,Barzcowgirl,"Yay!  I am so exicited I finally got this to work!  I have made butter before by skimming my own cream off of milk, but have never been able to get this to work. So, when I saw this recipe on this site, I thought I'd give it another shot.  I too used my kitchen aid mixer, which if you have one, I would reccommend. Simply because when it turn into butter, it all collects into the wisk an you can lift the top up and let it drip dry for a couple minutes!  The only thing I wasn't sure of was speed. What I learned was to use hi speed, but back it down a gear if it's splashing. When you start out it's a liquid. Start on speed 8 or it will spash. Once it takes on the whipping cream form, turn it on max. But stand by, because if your not there when the butter seperates from the liquid, it will go everywhere! So I slowly started backing it down!  After I put it in the bowl, I use the back of a spoon and squeeze out any excess milk I can and then I quicKly run cold water over it to wash it clean. just some tips I picked up from a butter making sight!  It's perfect and I am so happy to finally have this!! Thank You! 8-)",02/05/2010 16:50:10,02/05/2010 16:50:10

In place of the vegetable used 1/3 C. plus 2 TBSP pureed pumkin (have too many cans in the pantry, need to use up and adds a little Vitamin A), did not have any honey so used agave nectar (1/4 C.) and since some other reviewers had said these were not too sweet I added about 3 TBSP Splend Brown Sugar Blend into the mix.

The only negative was that the directions to make frosting seemed a little incomplete - but like I said, it really didn't need it.
I had to use olive oil instead of veg oil, but the cake was perfect anyway.

As per other reviews, I used 1 whoe egg and a 1/4 cup more blueberries. Also 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup honey plust a tbsp of Splenda. This was NOT enough sugar.  I don't like things very sweet, but even for me, I would have easily added 1/4 cup more of brown sugar. Still....very yummy and worth a try!",03/01/2010 04:30:45,03/01/2010 04:30:45

I added some Worcestershire, but after I served my DH--I took it back and added more Worcestershire.  I also think the wine I used was too cheap, because it seemed to have a very strong influence on the dish; I'm thinking a dry sherry would be better.

1061760,56,1565846,Indulge714,"I just made this pie last night because I was intrigued by its name.  I actually heard of it on a tv show and instantly wanted to make it.  I can't believe how simple it was to make.  I reduced the sugar to 1 cup, like many of the other reviewers recommended.   It was perfectly sweet. I love nutmeg in custard sweets, so I added just a touch. I think I may reduce the butter just a tablespoon or two; I had to sop up some of the the butter that had pooled a bit on top of the pie with a paper towel once it had come out of the oven.  But really, absolutely perfect pie. Great texture, great flavor. Delicious!!!

I cut back to just a little over a cup of sugar after reading some of the other reviews, but I messed up and put in a whole cup of butter instead of a half. I also turned up the oven to 450 and then cut it back to 350 and set it to bake for 55 minutes after the recommendation of another reviewer, but at the end of that time it was still soupy in the middle, so I just left it in and kept testing the center. I jiggled kept watching it, and discovered that the best test for done-ness is the jiggle test - when it goes from being runny to being gelatinous and wiggly in the center, it's done. It took more like an hour and 15 minutes at 350, but in the end it had a lovely golden caramelized top, the edges were golden and not overly done, and it was rich and delicious. I served it to a small group of friends and we all just loved it. It is a more custard-like version of pecan pie, with a creaminess replacing the corn syrup-ness.

I also threw in about a cup of grated sharp cheddar/monterey jack mix cheese.  It was perfect. Shared some with my mom and she's raving about it too!",03/18/2010 00:09:53,03/18/2010 00:09:53

My teacher had me cook my cucumber a bit before pureeing them. I cooked the cucumber in the chicken broth with the onion, parsley and white pepper. I did also add 1 minced garlic clove. I didn't chill this for the required 8 hours maybe 2-3 hours at most and it was very good. I did try this warm and it's much better cold. Overall I'd make this again!

It combines sweet (like sweet potatoes), Oriental and a stuffing-like taste. I do not believe the combination works at all.  It would work better to pick one of the styles, instead of combining tastes that don't work well together. 

Stuffing Style: remove the brown sugar and soy sauce, add some soft breadcrumbs, double the basil.

Oriental Style: substitute almonds for walnuts, remove brown sugar and basil.

Sweet Style: remove soy sauce and basil. Increase the brown sugar.",03/23/2010 20:47:28,03/23/2010 20:47:28

It's always nice to eat something that has been modified from the ""norm"" or how it is traditionally made and not notice a difference. Due to our personal tastes I added parsley to the cottage cheese mixture, rather then using fresh tomatos I used a 15oz can of diced tomatos, and double the amount of herbs used in the dish due to Marg's comment about it being slightly bland.

Anyone who knows me, knows that I feel a recipe is just a guide - and this was the perfect 'guide' to start with.  The only changes I made were:

 - I used butter, ""rock fish"";whatever that is :), garlic (because one can't have too much garlic).  
- As usual, I didn't measure the ingredients - just eyeballed it.
- Once the potatoes were cooked, I smushed some of them, and then added the fish and some dried parsley.
- Just before servicing, as a last minute thought, I sprinkled in some dried dill.

YUM ....... very good - and my picky ""meat & potatoes Husband"" really liked it.  Perfect comfort food (and healthy)  Had just enough to reheat for my lunch today.  Will be making this again.  THANK YOU for the great guide :)",04/13/2010 22:00:23,04/13/2010 22:00:23

The base had the right amount of crispieness on the outside and softness on the inside, and the addition of parmesan to the sauce makes it so tasty!

I doubled the beef (to 1 lb), didn't bother with the flour, and used two to three times as much water while simmering (added in increments). I had some ricotta to use up, so mixed it with the cottage cheese. I prepped in advance and stuck it in the fridge for a couple of hours before baking. Turned out perfectly!",05/08/2010 00:42:28,05/08/2010 00:42:28
1096898,1209,126440,adopt a greyhound,I made half a recipe and this is great.  I used fresh spinach which I wilted in a saute pan then mixed everything together.  Easy and delicious. Served with Recipe #95797.,05/09/2010 14:11:39,05/09/2010 14:11:39

I would have been happier if it had raised higher, it was a bit on the heavy side but did taste good. I used baking powder, you might want to fix the recipe ingredients list.

And also added a lot of almond meal, walnuts and lemon zest. I also did not have any baking soda, so I added 2-1/2 tsp baking powder instead of 2 tsp.

So fluffy and yummy, and great with butter. Thank you for posting.",05/14/2010 20:16:38,05/14/2010 20:16:38

So next time I make this, I'll use ice cubes instead of cold water, so it's far more chilled after blending.  But this will be a drink we'll have time after time this summer, because it's very refreshing when cold.  Thanks, Paula Maguire.",05/14/2010 22:41:47,05/14/2010 22:41:47
1099525,1541,565650,Chef 565650 Jim,"Very tasty dish that is simple and quick. Start with a little fresh minced  garlic and ginger and flavor your oil and flavor your whole dish at the same time. Used 8 large raw shrimp as it was a serving for 2. Do not use cooked shrimp and when cooking the shrimp, juices will be released from the raw shrimp that will flavor your whole dish. I shredded up some cabbage leaves very finely as I was out of fresh bean sprouts. The cabbage shreds and eggs were added right at the end so the cabbage would retain a great green color and not get mushy.

They turned out a little too soft, but I'm positive that's because I guesstimated some of the ingredient measurements.  Took some previous reviewers' advice and used only half the brown sugar, and it was perfect for us.  Thanks for sharing this quick, easy recipe!

1102530,607,1054210,UnRefined,"I'm sorry, I hate giving bad reviews.  I had such high hopes for this soup but it turned out terribly.  Perhaps I just like a more brothy French Onion Soup or maybe it was a weird reaction with my cast iron dutch oven.  It was very thick and the flour was not a good addition.  The paprika was overpowering (which is saying something when it's competing with onions) and tasted off.  My 4 year old loved it and had seconds which is why I gave it two stars but sadly DH and I did not like it at all.

It is lovely and sweet enough without any icing or glaze. This cake has a fine crumb and is very moist. I subbed out the almonds and almond liqueur/extract for banana liqueur, vanilla and a drop of orange extract; and added 1/4 or so cup of wheat germ.

I used less salt without any negative affect and instead of using butter and sauteing the lamb we used butter spray and used our stovetop grill pan.  My brilliant husband (he wanted me to make sure and put that part) put pieces of pineapple on the grill as well and it took up some of the flavors of the meat.  All were delicious.

I like to mix some dried thyme and rosemary into the pudding batter for added flavor.   **Important recipe notes:***In order to get these to really rise, you MUST mix up the batter ahead of time and let it sit out on your counter to get to room temperature. If the batter is too cold it doesn't have as much of a chance to rise, and you will end up with little flat hockey pucks!  Also, do NOT fill your muffin tins with batter..in fact I use only about 3/4 inch of batter in each muffin tin, to get the highest rising Yorkshire puddings.",06/01/2010 00:15:26,06/01/2010 00:15:26

This recipe is great and fairly straightforward. The first time I made them they came out a little bland. 1 Â½ tsp of salt for 4 Â½ cups plus of flour is a little too little in my opinion.

I let the buttermilk stand at room temperature for about 12 hours then refrigerate. Then the next morning make me some buttermilk biscuits and slather em up with some of that good ol butter.  P.S. Save a little buttermilk and add it to the cream the next time and let it sit out for a few hours at room temp to add a little extra flavor to the butter taste much deeper and complex.

Chocolate and avocado sounds worse than zucchini... anyhoo So after I dumped in the 1/2 cup of cocoa I made a sad face like this :( and tossed in an extra 2 tablespoons.  That cup of cocoa looked lonely.  Oh goodness the batter smelled delicious. Baked it for an hour, but I think that was just a smidge too long for me.  Next time I'll take it out a few min. earlier.  <br/><br/>This bread... makes an awesome peanut butter sandwich. haha!  My kids really liked it, even though my son claims he does not like chocolate.  I'm glad I tried it!",09/09/2010 23:19:59,09/09/2010 23:19:59

1168457,1209,666681,Johnsdeere,I made this as a appetizer for Thanksgiving and got alot of rave reviews on this one. I modified the recipe by adding 1/2 TBS of  garlic powder since my husband and I love it. With the leftovers we will be baking it on top of some chicken breasts with a little bit of mozzarella cheese 350 degrees for 35-40 minutes or until juices run clear. Thank you for the recipe!,12/01/2010 01:35:45,12/01/2010 01:35:45

Mine was a little overdone after being in for an hour, so I'd bake it for less, probably 50-55 minutes.  I will definitely make this again.",12/01/2010 13:55:41,12/01/2010 13:55:41
1168701,744,710155,jaybee chef,"Absolutely excellent.  I used 3 extra-large eggs to the 1 cup each of milk and flour with a little salt and let it come to room temperature. We didn't think they were too eggy with this ratio.  1 recipe was perfect for my jumbo muffin tins and made 6.  I took the suggestion of keeping the muffin tin hot on the stovetop while filling.  I baked 25 minutes, 23 would have been better in my oven since they browned just a little too much on the top.  Next time I  will try Herbes De Provence  or Fines Herbes or even just dried oregano for a little savory flavor, but they were really excellent without that addition.  This was a trial run for our Christmas prime rib dinner.  What an easy recipe and a delightful presentation.

1169399,116,1210689,Chef Swifticus,"Light and tasty, but I felt they lacked flavor the first time I made them. Second time I upped the lemon zest, and a bit more sugar, not much though. For appearance I added some striped glaze to mine. That can be done simply by mixing milk or orange juice with confectioner's sugar to get a good consistency. This adds alot to the initial presentation of the scones. Finally I made 12 scones with this recipe, instead of 8; they feel more correctly sized that way, previously they were too big.

Wasn't sure I would like the whole wheat but that really made it even better than all white flour.

Like other reviewers, I did not bake it for over an hour.  45-50 minutes max.  It's crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, as other reviewers have mentioned.

I purchased a can of Campbell's French Onion soup but it doesn't even begin to come close to how good this soup tastes.  I am glad that I found the recipe and now make it myself.  It's really not that hard at all to make.  I have a cuisnart food processor that I used for the onions & that really is the worst part of making the soup the onions.

1223851,120,244432,lindieb,"I think I looked at every single recipe for carrot cake on this site, and narrowed it down to 4, in an effort to find one like my Mother used to make - then narrowed it to 2, - I chose this one over one that was almost identical, except this one used more flour, both had the exact same amount of oil (the other just seemed like it would be tooooo greasy!).  I have to say your recipe is perfection.  I made this for a baby's first birthday and used part of the batter in a little 6 inch pan for the baby (so she could maul it, which she did and it was adorable) - and put the remainder in a standard tube pan for the adults.  I had omitted the nuts because of the baby, but topped the large cake with toasted pecans. Everyone raved about it, and had 2nds.  People love to add all kinds of things to carrot cake (raisins, pineapple etc), and those are ok - but I really prefer the elegance and texture of your recipe.  I grated the carrots by hand (I really wish I owned a food processor), on the tiny tiny side, so basically had pulp - it works out to be about 3 heaping cups, if anyone needs that as comparison.  The texture of the cake was like velvet, very moist but not heavy, as this type of cake can be.  Obviously I can't say enough about how much we enjoyed it.  Thanks so much for posting it, and I'm sure I'll never again use any other carrot cake recipe... oh one more thing, this recipe is super easy and I think even a novice baker would have success.  The only thing that took any time at all, was grating the carrots, and if you have a food processor, that would only take a few minutes.

The only thing that I do differently is, instead of mixing the flour with a can of broth, I add the flour to the paprika, salt and papper and make a roux by adding the mix to the tenderized onions.  You need to stir constantly because you don't want the mixture to scorch or brown, but you do want to cook it long enough to get the flour taste to disappear.  The roux takes about 10-20 minutes of stirring to get all the flour incorporated with the onion liquid.  After the roux is ready, slowly start adding your liquid, stirring all the time.  The result is a smooth, rich texture.  No lumps and no flour taste.  If it is too thick for your liking, add another can of broth.<br/><br/>If you're really ambitious...make your own stock!

I have to say this is the best so far cheesecake recipe I have ever made! The cheesecake taste, I think, better than the ones that takes days to cure without the long wait. I did make mine in the morning and it was ready for dinner dessert. <br/><br/>For those reviewers that read about someone having cracks, just use the humid box method of putting a pan of boiling water underneath the cake as it is baking. NEVER open the door or turn on the light until it's done baking. Follow those two simple steps and you won't have a crack one. <br/><br/>This recipe was well written and the results could speak for themselves if my family didn't devour the cake in one setting!

In a doubled recipe, 1/2 tsp. baking powder didn't seem like enough to 2 tsp. baking soda, so I upped the baking powder to 1 scant tsp. (for the doubled recipe). I drained my zucchini (which I did not peel), but I think my substitutions of half whole wheat flour and nonfat yogurt made the bread need extra moisture, so I might not do that next time.

1250994,1031,268888,LuckyMomof3,"Good recipe! Not a ""true"" chowder however. That's the reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars. I used the water from cottage roll making and just boiled the beans seperately to avoid losing too much liquid.  I added: potatoes, sweet potatoes , and celery (I didn't have carrots or green pepper). I took before and after pictures for fairness because as a soup it's very good and people may like it that way, I did, but I went ahead and made a chowder version and pic'd that too(because well now that I've been thinking about chowder ALL day, I had to :) ). I mashed 1/3 of the beans to thicken it (before adding to soup) and added 2-3 cups of milk, still not as thick as I'd prefer. It's very good both ways, Yum.

I had a slightly bigger (1.04 lbs.) piece of skin-on salmon, which I cut in half, then marinated for about 3 hours. Since I was using up a bottle of sesame seeds, I probably used about 1 tsp. per piece. I'm not sure I've ever broiled anything before, and was pretty unsure of the technique (mainly distance from the flame), but guess I did okay. I think I didn't reduce the sauce enough, though. Still, this was a fairly elegant recipe, though I didn't serve it with the fancy accompaniments suggested - just corn. I just might try this recipe again!",02/26/2012 16:33:17,02/26/2012 16:33:17

I used red, yellow and orange peppers, because we do not care for the green. I HIGHLY recommend cooking rice separately. So since I did cook rice separately from the ground beef, I omitted adding the water to the ground beef mixture. Therefore, just heating it about 10 minutes to heat the entire mixture once the tomatoes added.  Also I used our favoite Uncle Ben's, long grain wild rice w/broccoli. After rice cooked I just added it to the ground beef/onion/pepper/tomatoe mixture, then threw in the cheese and then stuffed my peppers. I had alot of the rice/beef mixture left so I did as another suggested and spread in the baking dish along with the peppers. This was soooooo good!

Next time think I'd only cook them about 3 minutes and then check.  Like them to be cooked but still firm when all finished.  After reading another reviewers input, I decided to go a little bit South American, so added Saizon seasoning mix and sofrito to the onion, pepper, beef mix. Gave a great flavor.  One other thing I changed was that I added 3 T Nuefchatel (cream cheese) to the cooked beef/tomato mix and stirred. Then added in cooked rice (used more than in recipe) and some cooked quinoa I had on hand.  Gave it a great creaminess without the heaviness of too much cheddar.

Used sour milk which I soured more with added white vinegar. This was better than I had anticipated. I made my own crust and lightly sprinkled the top of the pie with freshly grated nutmeg before baking. The edges were covered with tin foil the last 1 hour of baking to avoid burning the crust and I did reduce the sugar down to one cup replacing one quarter cup with dark brown sugar. Will make again.

1316407,468,1683962,Mrs. Atkins,"I really liked how easy this dish was. I could use all ingredients already in my pantry. The hardest part for a low-maintenance cook like me is marinating the fish ahead of time, but even that was pretty low-investment. I marinated the meat for about two hours on each side (flipping the salmon over half-way through because I was using a smaller container and had to fold the fish in half.)<br/><br/>I used the extra marinade once cooked over yellow squash and this is the kind of recipe where it will work with pretty much anything.<br/><br/>Note that the times should be switched above. Prep time is 2 1/4 hours, cook time is around 10 min.<br/><br/>Make sure you're not too stingy on oiling the pan or it will burn on juices which makes it tougher to clean.<br/><br/>Also I highly recommend serving with a wedge of fresh lemon. When you squeeze it on the finished entree it adds another dimension to the flavor which actually heightens the sweetness of the maple marinade.<br/><br/>Next time I'd love to try with some garlic and/or green onions as some of the other reviewers suggested.

We used the low fat ricotta, and used some Ragu instead of all the separate ingredients for the sauce. We do add all the herbs though because we like it to have a stronger taste.

Ok, so I didn't tell them that it was zucchini bread until they ate it, but a girl has to do what a girl has to do.  So naturally the next step was to try chocolate zucchini bread.  They all liked it, but they original version went over much better.  However tomorrow I am going to run to the store and pick up some heavy cream and fresh strawberries.  I have a feeling that if I cut some thick slices and top it with berries and real whipped cream this will be the new winner.

I've made every stew I could find over the course of 45  years, and never got that ""perfect"" taste that I was looking for.....until today.!!!  I can't believe that it uses a beer that I don't even like and turned out so good. (I didn't use 1/2 cup, just poured in the whole bottle.)<br/>I browned the meat and onions on the stove,(I did lightly dust the meat with some flour before browning,  made the broth, and poured into my crockpot.   I think that helped thicken the broth a bit.<br/>Then I added the sliced carrots, some celery and stirred them into the pot.Since my DH likes a little heat to his stew, I added about 1/2 jalapeno pepper.<br/>After the stew had cooked for one hour, I added cubed potatoes and cooked for another hour.  I added the frozen peas right at the end . The 2 hr. timing was perfect, although I did hold it on low for a while till dinner time. <br/>Thank you so much for this recipe......I think I will have it engraved on my cutting board...Ha.<br/>Donna<br/>UPDATE..........I tried this with another stout, but it just wasn't the same.

Since chicken is cut up, it should cook in less time. If you do a 400 F and 25 mins, you will get an over cooked and burnt chicken bites.

1347886,626,599450,mersaydees,"UPDATE to original review 11/12/08 under chef Sharon123: After reviewing both recipes posted under Carole Reu (who hasn't posted anything since 9/12/99) and Sharon123, I need my review to capture the complete recipe I originally reviewed, which is Sharon's. Carole's recipe isn't exactly like Sharon's and I need to note the differences so that I can continue to make the recipe I love as stated in my original review including Sharon's changes to the instructions. In my opinion these two recipes are different; however, this is food.com and I don't get to make that decision, as the food.com ""elves"" have merged these two recipes, hence my notes to self in the form of this revised review.  INGREDIENTS: ignore the 2 cups soybean flour, use 2 cups lentils versus 1 cup, and 5 tablespoon olive oil. DIRECTIONS: Step 3 - use blender;  Step 8 - place into 4 greased loaf pans; Step 9 - let rise until doubled in bulk and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour.Sharon's intro says, ""This bread will supply protein, calcium, phosphorus, iron, sodium, potassium, vitamins A and C, thiamine, riboflavin, and niacin. Plus it tastes good! Prep time includes time for the dough to rise. Made during Bible times, this is a Middle Eastern bread."" Next is my original review modified for the directions: Going into this I didn't realize it made 4 loaves! If I had I might have tried to scale it down a bit. So, drawing upon the strength of Ezekiel, I made it as directed! This also didn't fit my plans to use my KitchenAid mixer - too much volume! I had to make it by hand, which fortunately was therapeutic and cathartic. If you make it by hand because you don't have a commercial appliance, triple the estimated time it takes to make! Now that I've captured my thoughts on this, I can say that I give it 5 stars because IF you can put this together, the results don't disappoint. You may just have to use your brain on this one, and your heart! Thanks, Sharon123! Made for <b>Healthy Choices</b>.",11/18/2012 02:24:30,11/18/2012 02:24:30

Excellent flavor with just a bit of a kick.  Thank you Cindy for finally giving me a recipe for stuffed peppers I'll look forward to making again and again.",11/24/2012 01:01:14,11/24/2012 01:01:14

First, I exactly halved ALL of the ingredients (in case I didn't like it) and secondly, I took a tip from another reviewer and mixed the flour, paprika,pepper and salt together and put that in with the onions after their cooking time and made a roux and then added the broth. I think the total cooking time for the onions, 3 1/2 hours, is way too long, they were almost mush, and most of them disappeared into the liquid. I also thought that the paprika over-powered the onions, and gave the soup an off taste and an odd caramel color, which is why I added enough Kitchen Bouquet to try and offset that.

1363317,450,851841,Mantarae,"My husband and I lived in Malaysia for 4 years and became WELL acquainted with the local food.  We loved Gado-Gado which is Indonesian but the Malay love it also and it is seen on many restaurant menus throughout the country.  Southeast Asians normally peel their cucumbers but since we hae returned to living in the states I DON'T, not only because of the nutrient value, but also it adds color to the salad.  I also add shredded carrots to the salad for the same reason but keep the rest of the veggies most like how it was served in Malaysia and Indonesia. <3  The secret to having the BEST Gado-Gado is the fresh peanut sauce that is used as the dressing.  If making it fresh isn't your thing, try using Bangkok Padang Peanut Sauce found in your local Safeway store in the Ethic region.  It's the most like the Indonesian/Malay sauce served with this salad.  MOST recipes in Malaysia include Tofu cut into small cubes, dusted in cornstarch and fried up in a wok and then added on top of the salad just before serving.  It's wonderful!!

I tented with foil to avoid over-browning this, but it didn&#039;t really brown at all, probably due to the Splenda.

The only problem that I had was with my glaze. I was afraid that I was going to scorch it, so I removed it too soon and it didn&#039;t set properly. But in all honesty, my family loved it the way that it was. It ran down the sides of the cheesecake and was gooey. For my first cheesecake it was absolutely perfect, I couldn&#039;t have asked for any better. My DH said it was the best that he had ever ate even. Wow! Thanks so much for this keeper! Will be making this one again, and maybe even with the glaze the same way that I did this time.",05/28/2013 19:49:19,05/28/2013 19:49:19

I poured the batter into two pans of the size called for, popped them in the oven, and after 45 minutes poked them with a toothpick, which came out clean. Unfortunately I think I should have poked them about ten minutes sooner because its not very moist like so many people are saying. You definitely need something to drink with it and not because its overly sweet. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, with a properly adjusted cook time (I&#039;m thinking 30 to 35 minutes) I think this would turn out beautifully!

Once those were partially cooked I drained them and set them aside. I used 2 lbs of meat, ground beef and spicy italian ground sausage. I cut the zucchini in long strips about 1/4 inch thick and quickly balcned them in boiling water. I also used 1/2 cottage cheese and 1/2 ricotta cheese.

1406202,916,845729,wagzie,"Very good duplication of flavor of the fair ground version.  Comments: Added a dash of vanilla.  I used grape seed oil because it has a high smoke point and is light.  I reduced the recipe to 2 and still had leftover batter which I saved and will try that to see how well it holds up.  I used a funnel inserted into the top of a baster tube (no bulb) for better control and it worked well.  I used a medium sized cast iron skillet which gave just the right size per cake and reduced the  amt. of the oil.  I hand whisked the whole thing which I prefer to do when possible.  There&#039;s no oil temp indicated on recipe... I started on high and reduced to med. high but this will vary according to your stove.  Too hot will turn edges dark, too low and it absorbs too much oil before browning.  I&#039;d err on the side of too little batter per fry versus too much which end up with one big, solid cake.  Will follow up with success of using leftover batter for a second round.  All in all, I thought this was an extremely good sub for commercial funnel cakes and would definitely recommend and will repeat.  Oh yes, dusted with powdered sugar just like the fair vendors do.",09/09/2013 01:47:37,09/09/2013 01:47:37

I had extra batter, so I made 12 muffins and a mini-loaf of bread.  I think the muffins were sweet enough, but a bit bland.  I&#039;ll try adding a couple tablespoons of vanilla extract next time.  These worked well with my frozen blueberries.  I feel good about eating this recipe with a meal or as a snack.  I also made using light olive oil.

1428949,1209,1791142,samalita,"DEEEEELICIOUS!!! I sliced up some pumpernickel bread for dipping mine, but my 7 year old wanted to dip celery in hers. My 5 yr old ate it on chips. It is versatile and delicious.&lt;br/&gt;I did change a few things. &lt;br/&gt;1) I didn&#039;t have frozen spinach, so I chopped up some fresh. &lt;br/&gt;2) I used 1 cup of shredded parm and about 1 cup of small cubes of mozzarella (I had a big block and I didn&#039;t want to dirty my shredder, so I just chopped it into little cubes) It mixed and melted well. &lt;br/&gt;3) I read in a review that someone replaced the artichokes with mushrooms. Well, I love both so I kept both. I ended up adding 1 large baby portabello, diced. &lt;br/&gt;4) I also had some already cooked bacon chilling in my fridge just waiting for a recipe. So I chopped a slice up into tiny bits and mixed it in. (if you&#039;re not a vegetarian, this addition is a WIN!!) &lt;br/&gt;5) My artichokes were not from a jar. I found a package of &quot;ArtiHearts: fresh herbed artichokes&quot; from a company called Monterey Farms in the chilled produce section of my local store. They are the Herbal flavor. I just chopped &#039;em up and mixed &#039;em in. I really think this was one of the key ingredients for adding flavor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We give it two very happy thumbs up! I will definitely be making this again!! Thanks. :)&lt;br/&gt;6) I mixed this all up and then separated it into 3 parts (I wasn&#039;t making it for a party, just an afternoon snack) and put 2/3 into freezer bags and froze them for future snacking. The other 1/3 I put into a baking dish and sprinkled with a little more mozzarella and parmesan. I baked it about 25 minutes. It came out perfect!!",02/06/2014 04:19:30,02/06/2014 04:19:30

1429121,749,1800071363,AnnaBanana414,"I used this recipe as a jumping off point for an AWESOME 5-star lasagna.  I gave the recipe 4 stars because I changed almost everything about it, lol :)  So I have no idea how it would have tasted if I had followed the directions.  I don&#039;t eat red meat, so I used a pound of ground chicken and browned it with onions.  Instead of making sauce from scratch, I used an entire jar of Newman&#039;s Own marinara.  To boost the veggie power of the dish, I added a about a cup each of shredded carrots and roughly chopped baby bella mushrooms to the sauce (after sauteeing them in the &quot;drippings&quot; from the chicken &amp; onions).  I let that simmer while I prepared the rest of the ingredients.  DO NOT STRESS about slicing the zucchini super thin.  The thinner pieces did not hold up very well and the thicker pieces were nice to bite into.  I used 4 whole zucchinis, - including the outside edge pieces - and sauteed them with a little bit of olive oil, salt/pepper and chicken stock.  I could have eaten those alone.  For the cheese, I mixed equal parts shredded mozzarella and shredded sharp cheddar into the ricotta/egg mixture for a bolder flavor.  I also added about a half cup of thawed frozen chopped spinach and a touch of chicken stock with salt/pepper.  Next time I might try a little lemon juice and/or zest for zing.  After layering the ingredients I refrigerated the whole thing for a couple of hours because I had to step out and that was totally fine.  when I got back I baked it for 30 minutes at 375 then sprinkled the rest of the mozzarella/cheddar mixture on top, fired up the broiler, and seared a it to a nice crispy finish.  It was delicious!  To avoid getting too chubby by wolfing down all that cheese at once, I am planning to serve the reheated leftovers on a bed of sauteed shredded zucchini, mushrooms, and spinach tonight.

This is delicious, and very close to the original.  I did not thicken- and glad I didn&#039;t, this soup was perfect without it.  To add body without thickening with flour (which leaves a goopy, pasty consistency)....use just 2-3 short pulses with an immersion blender.  This will still leave chunks of onion, but will puree just slightly and break up the longer strings of onion.  You will end up with a silky textured, rich but still thin broth.  Add the bread and cheese, and the soup will have plenty of body.  &lt;br/&gt;I also did not feel the need to add Kitchen Bouquet. &lt;br/&gt;Next time I will reduce the paprika just slightly, for good balance with the onions.

This recipe made enough for my husband and I to enjoy (with leftover) and wound up with enough to send half to our neighbors, whose daughter had just graduated high school. I sent the soup, slices of Swiss and smoked provolone slices, a simple tossed salad and a loaf of french bread. If not for the surplus, I would have sent only a handmade card with cash (they are incredible neighbors). Variation: I had no white wine (drank it all; it&#039;s summer!) so, I used the same measurement of vegetable stock with about five dashes of white wine vinegar as a substitution. It started to get a little thick for my taste so, I added an extra cup of beef stock after the final simmering stage, turned the heat off and let sit for 30 mins. The flavor and consistency was perfect at this point. I have had soup of the same, thicker consistency that sticking to the exact recipe yields and it was great but, not &quot;bullseye!&quot;. If I have my perfect French onion, it is a little soupier; that and necessity (substituting veggie stock/ white wine vinegar) is the only reason I deviated from the recipe. I will be making this every week for lunches. I have been paying 4 bucks a bowl. I can make a whole stock pot full for that and change.

My review will be the third review. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This noodle dough was very easy to make and worked as written, although today I needed less flour. The dough is great to handle and roll out. I roll and cut all of my noodles by hand as I don&#039;t have a pasta machine of any kind, and don&#039;t intend to buy any. This made a very supple, easy to roll dough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I made two slight changes-I always knead my pasta dough for 15 minutes as it makes it even more supple, and I used bread flour, not a-p flour as written. Bread flour has more gluten than a-p flour and you can even make pasta without eggs with bread flour because of the higher gluten content. Pasta made with a-p flour will also be tougher than that made with bread flour. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I followed a new tip for the first time today: wrap the dough in plastic wrap while it&#039;s resting, and keep the resting pieces of dough in it as you roll out the rest of the dough. I have been covering it with my pastry cloth, and the plastic wrap is much better and I will do that from now on. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I can and do highly recommend this recipe.

Since I&#039;m always looking for ways to cut calories, I made it without a crust. Crust is not my favorite part of pie anyway and we didn&#039;t miss it.

It would be easy to prepare this for a fresh, home-made weeknight dinner.  I followed the recipe and agree that butter is the way to go.  It adds such a nice flavor and texture to the broth, and is a healthier fat than margarine or cooking oil.  I also used 12 oz of non-fat evaporated milk instead of whole regular milk.  And I included the carrots ? I have eaten chowder all up and down coastal Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts and have had it both with and without.  Both are good, but I am a firm believer in there can?t be too many carrots in soup.  We served it with a salad for dinner, and there was enough chowder leftover for lunches.  To that we added some saut&eacute;ed watercress and that was a nice addition.  It didn?t affect the flavor of the chowder, but the lingering flavor was only of the watercress.  The chowder held and reheated nicely.  I put it in a saucepan on the stove very low to heat it slowly and avoid the risk of scalding the milk.",03/25/2015 21:53:06,03/25/2015 21:53:06

1480769,1356,2600905,wluckeroth,"I finished the meat, vegetables, and rice for 20 minutes after saut&eacute;ing the ingredients first, adding the chopped tomatoes, etc. The organic long grain rice didn&#039;t finish cooking ( still hard), so I decided to simmer it for another 15 minutes. Hopefully, it will be ready by then because I already have my oven preheated to 350&deg;. I have a gas range and oven. Was the recipe cooked, and baked in an electric range? When I tasted the mixture to assure that the rice was tender, it tasted great, but the rice was still hard. My range is high end, and I was cooking the ingredients on the Ultra Power Burner. All the liquid had evaporated, which would have been fine if the rice would have been ready, so I switched it to a regular burner after adding a little water. It was starting to stick. Let&#039;s see. I&#039;m an experienced cook, and I realize that recipes sometimes need tweeting depending upon ingredients used, and range/oven differences. Also, I live in the Midwest. Also, I have a home in the tropics, and weather conditions can vary results. I think that the recipe will be fine once the rice is ready, and the baking is finished.

1. Used 1 teaspoon of soy sauce instead of straight salt. It gave some additional flavor to the meat with less salt.
2. Instead of chopped bell peppers in the filling. I used chopped serrano chillies. We like our food very hot!
3. I Added 2 teaspoons minced garlic to the filling.
3. After baking, I topped with a spicy maraneria sauce and Mozzarella cheese and placed back into thr oven until the cheese was melted.

It took much longer than  45 minutes to bake and I also put a small amount of water in the bottom of the baking dish and did not cut a piece off the bottom, they sat at only a slight angle and were fine.

Unfortunately, I didn&#039;t think to reduce the cooking time, with the result that the meatloaf was a bit blackened around the edges (the dog enjoyed those bits with his dinner).

My nanny Watters even made it out of roast chicken, and it was great also. This dish was made as far back as the early 16th Century, as Elizabeth 1 cooks had the recipie on file.

My first time making it, I didn't do this so I had some spots harder then others and some soft, When I made sure it was even... no problem. Also, pressing it all down firmly is IMPORTANT.

Don't use cheap cheese, Parmigiano Reggiano is a good option for flavor. 2.Melt the butter in a sauce pan low heat to prevent separation. If it does, start over. 3.Slowly whisk in the cream and let simmer for about 1 -3 minute until mixture starts to thicken. The real thickening will occur with the addition of the cheese. 4.Add drained pasts to creamy, buttery mixture. 5. Remove from heat before adding the parmigiano to the Alfredo cream mixture and toss. Sauce will quickly thicken over time so wait at least 1 min before deciding to add more cheese to thicken. For thinner or thicker sauce adjust with amount of cheese but every time I follow these instructions the sauce is thick and sticks to the pasta.

OK, for the most part I followed the recipe exactly. However, I did use a couple of suggestions that were made here. I did add mini chocolate chips and sprinkled raw sugar on the top. OH, and I added carrots with the zucchini. Now, I used my mandolin slicer to &quot;shred&quot; the zucchini and carrots and it came out more like a pulp. So, I drained that off as much as possible. In all, to make 2 cups, I used 3 zucchinis and 2 carrots. I only have 1 loaf pan, so I decided to make mini muffins first, then I poured the rest of the batter into my loaf dish. On 350 with convection, the muffins took 20 minutes. The loaf, however ended up taking 1 hour and 20 minutes. Maybe there was a little too much batter in the loaf pan because it took forever for me to get a clean toothpick in the middle. But, when all said and done.........

I cut Paprika in half based on a review I read here, figuring I could add more during simmer if my taste buds suggested it needed more. Also, based on comments here, I cut the flour to 1/2 c. It is still just a bit thick for my liking, especially after soaking into the baguette. But thinning is pretty easy using that magic ingredient. During simmer tasting, I felt something was lacking. It was a bit bland. After reading other recipes to see what it might need, I settled on adding Worcestershire sauce and Thyme. I added 3 generous pinches of Thyme and started adding dashes of Worcestershire, probably about 15 dashes total, and they did the trick. Don't know if the Thyme did anything, but the Worcestershire did. I know some don't like it when you review a recipe you have tweaked.

2027548,1356,2001659820,Michael K.,My dad (a chef) did things slightly different. He 'blanched' the peppers to soften them so that they would not break when stuffing. He also made a rice and ground beef filing first. You can add spices and other ingredients as you please. He then would take the uncooked ground beef and rice mixture and gently line the inside of each pepper and fill the bottom of the pepper to about 1/4. He then placed a large piece of WHITE extra sharp cheddar (use Kraft Vermont or other but it must be white). He finished filling each pepper with the raw beef and rice mixture. The poured about 1-2 TBSP of pasta sauce over the filled pepper and then placed another thick slice of white cheddar on top of that and pour more pasta sauce over that. He cooked it in the over covered for about 50-60 minutes where the rice would could in the ground beef drippings as well as the cheese inside would melt. Of course the cheese on top would also melt. I would recommend 90% - 95% beef versus the usual 80/20. You do not want too much fat. But the juices continue to cook the pepper as well as the rice. When served have a side of pasta sauce. When you cut open the pepper the White Cheddar cheese mixed with the ground beef and rice would just run. The White cheddar has a different flavor and chemically creates a very different flavor than the orange cheddar. Growing up we had a tradition that my family was allowed to have their favorite dinner for their birthday and mine was always Dad's stuffed bell peppers.,08/06/2017 23:21:00,08/06/2017 23:21:00

2038925,1078,2001861551,patriciafraker,"I have to share how this recipe gave me ideas to create a salsa from what I had in the kitchen, for an emergency. I had no cilantro and was kicking myself, so I tried half Italian parsley and half fresh marjoram. Marjoram is a good substitute for cilantro in a pinch. We don't like onions and garlic, so I always use ginger and jalapeno saut&eacute;d a little, then water added. This time I also used some chopped cherry bomb red pepper w/o seeds of course (that I had frozen from summertime). We have low-sodium requirements in our family, so I never use salt. It worked great without salt! Lime juice, olive oil, cumin and black pepper is a truly genius combo. When I added those to my chopped cooked tomatoes mixture, it tasted a fantastic salsa. Thank you so much for turning me onto using those four items. It turned my mash into a true salsa flavor, even though using ginger not onions. I have finally figured out the key ingredients. I am so grateful for this site. I have to share that all I had were some cherry salad tomatoes and chopped up those with a half of a regular tomato, simmered, and it worked out ok. I added the parsley marjoram raw at the end. This recipe base seems very flexible.

2042919,334,2001482430,annemarie.resume,"re: Storage Just figured I'd share a storage tip. If you've ever heard of a Brown-Sugar Bear, it works on the same principle. I got a Brown Sugar Bear in a kitchen-specialty shop/probably available on line. It's a molded piece of clay pottery (just like plants in clay pots)... The directions were to soak the Brown Sugar bear in water for 20 minutes - and afterwards, dry it off and place it in your bag of brown sugar - it literally keeps the brown sugar pliable...so you never ever have to throw away the rock-hard brown sugar. If you should ever find your brown sugar getting hard, you repeat the soaking process and your hard brown sugar will soften again by storing it with the Brown Sugar Bear. Now, as far as cookie storage, you could either get another brown sugar bear, or you can just head down to Lowes or Home Depot and get a clay saucer - the small one will suffice. Just be sure it's never been used and that it's clean/free of debris (but do NOT use soap: just rinse it off. Then soak it just like a Brown Sugar Bear for 20 minutes... and then dry it off and tuck it in the bag with your cookies - whether these shortbread or any fresh cookies (our friend gives trays of home made cookies at Christmas, and they always go stale before we get to the last ones, but I remember my Brown Sugar Bear and used a clay saucer soaked in water as I've said and they stay wonderfully fresh! You won't be disappointed, trust me. My hubby delivers a nationally known brand of cookies, so we are somewhat cookie snobs, usually preferring his brand -vs- home made, but ever since we've employed the Brown Sugar Bear clay-soaked pottery trick, we've learned to appreciate home-made cookies as fresh as the day they were made!",01/22/2018 04:58:19,01/22/2018 04:58:19

The dish had a very fresh taste to it that i liked, I was in the mood to eat something nice and fresh and juicy. But then 2nd batch I made in my Webber Kettle, uncooked, I just brushed the peppers with a flavour infused olive oil, and dusted the inside of the pepper with Italian smoked paprika. And Wow what a different taste, nutty, spicy. I do like to dry fry my foods, meaning very little good quality olive oil, or coconut oil, even better. And here is the twist, use roasted chick pea and dollop of sour cream. Cilantro chopped up or yogurt, I have done breakfast the same way just filled with fresh organic eggs, shallots or spring onion with a bit of turmeric.

My daughter actually made this and told me she made Mississippi Mud. I told her sorry but it’s not. I can’t believe people misname or rename things wrongly but maybe they accidentally didnt really know.

I did not use rice to make it low carb and when I stuffed the pepper I would alternate between beef and cheese -- so it is like a pasta but inside of a green pepper. Also I bought spicy pasta sauce and used that instead as it gave it a bit of a kick without it being overly spicy. Also I do not boil the green peppers, but put them straight into the over at the tempterature stated and let it cook for longer. Doing it this way softens the pepper just enough without it becoming mushy (which frankly, is disgusting). Oh and you don't have to use green peppers, if you want some color try red, yellow or even orange. One more change, I don't use cheddar cheese but either a two or three cheese blend.

I also used yellow, orange and red peppers instead of green - just because.",05/13/2020 23:29:53,05/13/2020 23:29:53
2083880,1209,1545542,greekmiss,This dip was excellent! I loved it. The only thing I did a little different was I put in on broil for an additional 5 minutes to get some crisp on the top of the dip. Next time I want to try making it somehow in a bread bowl - we'll see how that goes!,05/24/2020 19:06:24,05/24/2020 19:06:24
2084036,572,2001622362,Kay J.,"I love this recipe. I have fried green tomatoes like this all my life, but have never tried the sugar on them. Since I love the tart green tomato tang I don't think the sugar would be for me. I can easily eat a whole pan full of these tomatoes accompanied only by horseradish sauce &amp; bread &amp; butter.",05/27/2020 23:09:51,05/27/2020 23:09:51
2085716,1356,2002612153,Amy S.,"Delicious and easy to make. We steamed the peppers instead of boiling them and used red, orange and yellow peppers to clean out our fridge. I was worried the mixture would be too simple but it was perfect. Will definitely make these again. They would probably be great with any cheese of your choice, too.",07/16/2020 07:02:31,07/16/2020 07:02:31

2086157,1982,2000746235,Robert C.,I just made this dressing for a tomato cucumber salad after discovering I was out of Good Seasons. This is a pretty close approximation! I took a cue from the comments and used all powders instead of salts and just added the 2 TBSP of kosher salt indicated. It turned out perfect! Thanks for saving me!,07/29/2020 10:41:50,07/29/2020 10:41:50
2086841,1356,2002805524,Alison P.,"I was given four large green peppers and needed a recipe that was simple, but had good flavor. This is my first time making stuffed peppers, so I didn't really know what to expect. It was so good. Everyone in my household was happy with dinner tonight. This will be my go-to stuffed pepper recipe from now on.",08/25/2020 08:26:34,08/25/2020 08:26:34

2088003,822,2002496428,Barb H.,I have made these for years. I usually use a dark chocolate cake mix and add chocolate chips. My daughter made these (the chocolate ones) for an office pitch-in once and she was ordered (jokingly) by her boss to bring them in at least once a month!!,10/12/2020 08:44:42,10/12/2020 08:44:42

2089450,607,2002874060,Jennifer d.,"This is the soup, as I remember it! As I read through comments/suggestions I made a couple of tweaks. I used red wine, this caused no need for kitchen bouquet. I also used have beef broth and chicken broth. This makes me feel like I’ve found home! Thank you",12/03/2020 00:59:06,12/03/2020 00:59:06
2089574,230,2002876421,Rhonda E.,"Although these were nice &amp; fudgy, the cookies flattened out so much that they looked like ice burgs on my cookies instead of a cracked ice effect if that makes any sense. The taste is great! Just wish they didn't spread so much....I used 2 different pans (teflon &amp; baking stone) to see if that would help, but to no avail. I also read the reviews and made sure that the cookies were covered in icing sugar &amp; the dough was kept in the fridge overnight for about 22 hours. I think I did everything right! Guess they are iceburg cookies this year! :)",12/07/2020 01:25:34,12/07/2020 01:25:34
